## Long description

The talented youth encourages and acknowledges young artists working in media arts through programs that showcase their talent and accomplishments. We strive to provide networking, address educational needs, and expand opportunities that allow exceptional work to be seen by large and diverse audiences. Held annual nffty (national film festival for talented youth) for the promotion and education of young media artists, and began preparation for nffty 2015.
