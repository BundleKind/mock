## Long description

The mountains to sound greenway trust conserves and enhances the landscape from seattle across the cascade mountains to central washington, ensuring a long-term balance between people and nature. Stewardship: each year, greenway volunteers donate more than 40,000 hours to outdoor trail and restoration projects and plant more than 20,000 native trees and shrubs. Over 50% of volunteers are youth. Greenway trust crews continue construction on a new 5-mile trail and trailhead at mailbox peak, and finished removing 11 miles of forest roads in the granite lakes area of the middle fork valley.
