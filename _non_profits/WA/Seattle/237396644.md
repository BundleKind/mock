## Long description

United friends empowers people with developmental disabilities to enjoy quality lives and experience the best of home, health, family and community. We provide housing in three private homes with private bedrooms for six to eight residents per home. Residents live as a family unit, sharing meals and other activities. Each home is an attractive house in a residential neighborhood. There is 24 hour staffing to provide whatever assistance each resident needs for normal activities of daily life such as health care, medications, transportation, meals, laundry, and safety. Individual residents are assisted in discovering and developing their skills and interests. We facilitate access to vocational, medical, and psychiatric services. A wide variety of recreational, leisure, and vocational activities are accessed and coordinated. Relationships with family members are assisted as appropriate.
