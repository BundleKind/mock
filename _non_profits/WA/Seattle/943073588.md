## Long description

To improve the environment for efficient and substantial non-profit initiatives which promote the long-term availability of affordable housing for low-income persons by, but not limited to (1) improving operations and enhancing the production capacity of nonprofit developers; (2) raising funds and developing equity to support housing initiatives; and (3) education of non-profit developers and the public. Hdc provides collaborative settings and opportunities for nonprofit developers and others to increase affordable housing. Hdc works closely with government, environmental advocates and community coalitions to raise the awareness of the broad benefits of affordable housing and to implement sound public policies that lead to increases in the quantity and quality of such housing throughout king county. Recent accomplishments include:the hdc racial equity initiative was launched to help hdc members apply a racial equity lens to their practices in order to achieve a more just, dignified, connected, and accommodating king county. Hdc developed a racial equity toolkit that provides an analysis of racial equity in the affordable housing sector as well as foundational information about racial equity. Throughout 2014 hdc hosted a series of workshops for organizational members to learn how to utilize this toolkit, as well as other hdc-developed tools (i. E. , racial equity self-assessment tool, organizational plan template, policy impact tool).
