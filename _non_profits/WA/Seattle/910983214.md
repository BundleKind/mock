## Long description

The foundation is committed to supporting the efforts of swedish health services in advancing health care in the region and meeting the health care needs of the community. Community support/swedish support - these unrestricted donations provide swedish with the flexibility to devote funds to essential, patient-centered, high-priority needs of the swedish institutes and enterprises. In 2014 gifts help fund a variety of projects supporting technology, research and education including the following: (a) the latest medical technology such as a musculoskeletal ultrasound transducer that provides our physicians with real-time, noninvasive pictures to help diagnose and treat msk conditions and provides our patients with safe, painless diagnostics. (b) supports advanced research such as proper storage of cellular and tissue specimens, particularly for patients with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. (c) gives patients such as those with diabetes the educational tools they need about their diagnosis and symptom management to better understand and manage their disease.
