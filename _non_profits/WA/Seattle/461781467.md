## Long description

We raise funds to build wheelchairs and supply other aids, free of charge, to the many disabled of nigeria, especially polio survivors and the visually impaired. Grants were given to beautiful gate handicapped people center in jos, nigeria. The 34 employees in the workshop built and donated 1273 tricycle-type wheelchairs to polio survivors and 10 artificial legs to amputees. Also donated 134 pairs of crutches, as well as 90 folding white canes and 50 digital voice recorders to blind students.
