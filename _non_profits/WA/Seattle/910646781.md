## Long description

Fiuts connects university students with local and global communities through programs that build international awareness, cross-cultural communication, and informed leadership. Short-term programs welcome groups of high school and college-aged students from around the world to seattle for leadership, civic engagement, and service themed programs that provide them with the tools they can use to inspire change in their home communities.
