## Long description

Pacific northwest ballet association's mission is to set new standards for artistic excellence, innovation and creativity; attract the most talented dancers, choreographers, musicians, collaborative artists, staff and volunteers; educate and develop dance artists as well as enthusiasts; captivate a devoted, supportive, growing and diverse audience; and strengthen our financial and organizational foundation. Pacific northwest ballet association (pnb) consists of forty-six dancers and a live orchestra which presents about 110 performances including six repertory productions of full-length and mixed repertory ballets, the holiday classic, nutcracker, tours and a season-ending encore performance. The company's repertory includes 266 works by 109 choreographers and continues to expand as new choreography is introduced each season. Through almost 250 public events (including performances, community outreach, and fundraising events) at marion oliver mccaw hall in seattle, as well as national and international venues, such as tours to new york, virginia, and massachusetts, pnb reaches more than 225,000 community members annually. Pnb's state of the art studios serve as rehearsal space.
