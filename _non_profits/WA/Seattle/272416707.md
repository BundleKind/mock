## Long description

Promoting the northwest arts community by providing tools, education and exposure to help artists succeed. Creating and promoting art marketplaces which we use to educate the public through activities and demonstrations of the creative process. Three best of the northwest art and fine craft marketplaces in 2015 provided opportunities for 275 artists to display and sell their work. Many of our artists are women and minorities. These community events attracted more than 9,000 members of the public. The events provided interactive artist demonstrations and activities for both adults and children. We continued our emerging artist program providing mentoring with seasoned artists and showcasing the work of three new talents to the local art community and public. We initiated art in the park at south lake union, partenered with business leaders and the city of seattle, consulted with the city of redmond on their art event series and continued our long partnership with preston kuppe guild at seattle childrens hospital to raise funds for uncompensated care.
