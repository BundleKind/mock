## Long description

To surround students with a community of support, empowering them to stay in school and achieve in life. Individualized student support - through site coordination, the organization places a site coordinator at selected k-12 schools to work with students who are most vulnerable for dropping out: young people affected by gangs, violence, family disruption, and poverty. Students receive support to raise academic achievement, reduce truancy, and address barriers to learning. Personalized support to students and their families helps them to overcome social and emotional obstacles that stand in the way of students fully engaging in school. They also provide school-wide activities that bring together the whole school, resources for students, and/or the students into the community.
