## Long description

Mission: the mission of seattle tilth is to inspire and educate people to safeguard our natural resources while building an equitable and sustainable local food system. Vision: seattle tilth envisions a future where all people have access to fresh nutritious food, and the resources needed to sustain and protect our health and our environment. Education - seattle tilth provides people with science-based education and hands-on experiences through a wide variety of educational opportunities including classes on organic gardening and farming, raising urban livestock, and nutrition and food preservation. People who participate in these activities are encouraged to develop a stronger relationship with the natural world, increase their understanding of a specific topic and become empowered to take personal action that will contribute to a healthier lifestyle and environment. Seattle tilth's educational programs take place at our five learning gardens and three farms, as well as at schools, parks, p-patch and community centers throughout the region.
