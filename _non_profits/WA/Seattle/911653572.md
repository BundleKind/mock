## Long description

To promote educational exchange between people of different cultural backgrounds, including, but not limited to, promotion of instruction, training and competition in the game of 'go. '
  
  in fy2014, the seattle go center shared the asian game of go at five cultural festivals and nine other events, and we provided teachers for three school go clubs. We offered one weekly class for beginners at the go center and provided informal lessons and teaching games to new players on a 'walk-in' basis every tuesday and saturday. All beginner lessons at the go center are free of charge. For advanced students, we conducted two free evening classes, one free saturday class, one weekend workshop by a visiting professional, three other teaching visits by pros, and teaching games with stronger players three days a week. We ran 12 tournaments that were rated by the american go association. We have about 100 visits a week to the go center, with 30 50 players of all levels regularly attending on tuesday nights. This is the largest weekly gathering of go players in north america.
