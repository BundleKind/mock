## Long description

Provide comprehensive child
  
  we served 12 children and their families by providing education and school readiness through the eceap program. We assisted additional 40 working families with the care and education of their children while they are at work or school as an early learning center. We also provided before and after school pprograms for older children who attend school all day. Accomplishments include completing a successful year of our eceap program by graduating 6 preschoolers prepared for kindergarten. We served over 50 families by providing high quality care, family support and access to health and dental screening. We participated in the community as an educational resource. We accepted state of washington child care subsidy payments for over 90% of our students. The state pays only 60% of our tuition rate, so we subsidize the difference in our program.
