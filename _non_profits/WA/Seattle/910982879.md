## Long description

To improve the well being of children by effecting positive changes in public policies, priorities, and programs. High quality early learning lays a foundation for a strong future. But too many young children don't get a chance to build the fundamental brain architecture that allows them to thrive in school and in life. In 2015, children's alliance made major progress in expanding access to quality early learning by informing the content and funding of and advocating for passage of the early start act. The new policies in the act will help ensure that new resources improve outcomes for children in low-income families and children of color.
