## Long description

The primary purpose of the fund is to promote social welfare, including promoting the oral health of the public, and to sponsor and innovate for the advancement of oral health. The fund supports the mission of delta dental of washington (ddwa) and washington dental service (wds) by supporting access to oral health through a mobile clinic in underserved geographic areas, and through grants to support access to dental care for children. The fund supports dental care in underserved areas of washington state through a program called the smilemobile; a 40 foot modern dental clinic on wheels that has been serving children in need across washington state since 1995. The smilemobile was created to bring dental services - at little or no charge - directly to children who do not otherwise have access to dental care. Since it first hit the road, the mobile clinic has treated more than 34,000 children throughout the state.
