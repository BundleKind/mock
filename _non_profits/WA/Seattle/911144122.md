## Long description

The nw energy coalition is an alliance of more than 115 environmental, civic and human service organizations, progressive utilities, and businesses in oregon, washington, idaho, montana and british columbia. We promote development of renewable energy and energy efficiency, consumer protection, low-income energy assistance, and fish and wildlife restoration on the columbia and snake rivers. Policy: the coalition engages in in-depth policy analysis and advocacy on a wide range of energy policy issues at the utility, state, regional and federal level. We convene disparate voices and perspectives to engage in dialogue, come to a common understanding and move forward with a shared solution. Our policy work advances utility and government energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including building codes, equipment standards, low-income energy programs, distributed generation, renewable energy portfolio standards, and coal plant retirement strategies. Policy work analyzes utility regulatory issues including rate design, utility business models, electrification of transportation, and the energy system impacts of operational changes to the hydroelectric dams in the columbia river basin.
