## Long description

Teens in public service tips is dedicated to producing future leaders committed to their communities by connecting teens with life-changing opportunities and internships at non-profit organizations. The tips program serves three groups in the puget sound region teens, non-profits, and the community at-large. Tips inters represent a multi-ethnic group of teens ages 15-19 from across king, snohomish, and pierce counties who demonstrate proven leadership skills and an interest in serving their community. Tips interns work in a wide array of non-profit agencies that provide various services to the population of seattle. Tips began with just 11 interns serving 7 non-profit organizations. Today more than 900 teens have completed the tips program and tips has partnered with over 125 non-profit organizations in the past 18 summers, combining to provide over 160,000 hours of service in the community. The mayor's of seattle have endorsed our program for the past 19 years, acknowledging the unique and valuable opportunity the tips program offers this region's youth.
