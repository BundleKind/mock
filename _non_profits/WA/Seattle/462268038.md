## Long description

To set the table for young people to transform the health and equity of their community by gathering around food and working towards systems change. We hope youth, people of color and immigrants begin to be viewed as an important and powerful force in the food justice movement. The weekly dinner program gathers 35-40 youth once a week to cook an improvised dinner using a table full of fresh vegetables from local markets and farmers. Everyone in the room collaborates in the design of the menu and co-creates healthy dishes in an engaging, non-hierarchal, youth led setting.
