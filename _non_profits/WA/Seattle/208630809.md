## Long description

Tisbest is fueling a movement to replace gifts of 'stuff' with gifts of 'good' that meaningfully connect individuals to important philanthropic causes. The engine of this mission is the tisbest charity gift card, which works like a conventional gift card with one important distinction: the recipient spends this card by selecting a charity to support with the money on the card. Recipients of tisbest charity gift cards can use them by entering a unique code on the tisbest website and directing the funds from the card to a charity of their choice from our list of charities on the website.
