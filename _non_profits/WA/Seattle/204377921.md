## Long description

Project access northwest collaborates with the health care community to open doors to medical and dental care for the low income individuals through a distributed network of donated care that assures appropriate access to medical and dental specialty care services. - project access northwest (panw) links low income uninsured and underinsured king, kitsap and snohomish county patients to volunteer specialty providers. Working with the community health centers and free clinics, panw assures that access to specialty care services by providing care management services. Panw assures that the client is eligible, that information such as labs and imaging are available at the time of the scheduled appointment. Our patients have a lower no-show rate (about 5% compared to 30+% for typical uninsured or medicaid patients), are more likely to show up on time and be prepared to work with the specialist on his/her care. In 2014, 2,744 patients were appointed by panw for medical services in our three county service area. They were served by approximately 1,300 licensed clinicians.
