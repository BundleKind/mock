## Long description

Hopecentral has a two-fold mission:* to share the love of christ by meeting the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of the rainier valley through an affordable primary care medical home * to engage the resources of the church in a compassionate healing community
  
  hopecentral conducted over 900 medical and behavioral health encounters in our first year of operations, staffing office hours 20 hours per week and providing on-call services to our patients using an all-volunteer medical team. || responding to needs in the community, hopecentral developed an autism spectrum evaluation and was designated as an autism center of excellence by the washington healthcare authority in the spring of 2015. We provide evaluation, education and support for families affected by autism spectrum disorder. || hopecentral developed a trauma-informed care plan for a large homeless shelter for women and children. This comprehensive plan included a framework to strategically provides services to residents as well as structures for critical incident handling, staff support, and ongoing advocacy.
