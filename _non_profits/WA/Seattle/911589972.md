## Long description

The neighborhood farmers market alliance's mission is to support washington's small farms and farming families by providing effective direct sales sites for our region's small farmers, and by educating consumers about farm products and the benefits of buying direct from local farmers. Provided effective direct sales sites for our region's small farmers and educated consumers about farm products and the benefits of buying direct from local farmers. We currently operate seven local, 'producer-only' neighborhood farmers markets. This means we sell only washington state farm produce and processed foods.
