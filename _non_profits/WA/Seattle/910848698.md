## Long description

Improving the quality of life of people vulnerable to mental illness by providing a broad continuum of care. Inpatient services - the 24hour, 7dayperweek facility, located on navos' west seattle campus, cares for persons living with mental illness who are experiencing an acute psychiatric crisis requiring stabilization. The inpatient program is licensed for 76 beds. Thirtyfour of these beds are operated as an evaluation and treatment unit under a contract with king county. Navos primarily serves those who are involuntarily committed because they are deemed to be in imminent danger of harm to themselves or others. A structured environment of individual patient evaluation, treatment, and discharge planning takes place with every patient. Along with psychiatric and stabilization services, navos provides inpatient adjunctive therapies, including therapeutic groups, recreation and activities, art therapy, dance/movement therapy, psychodrama, poetry therapy, and psychosocial education.
