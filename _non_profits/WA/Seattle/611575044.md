## Long description

To help empower low income people in washington state by providing financial education, outreach and advocacy using the resources at our partner credit unions, and in doing so, help our clients build assets and achieve financial resilience. Financial resiliency: financial education and coaching focused on basic capabilities matched seamlessly with appropriate and flexible products and services allowing participants to gain access to financial products and services at a credit union and learn how to navigate the financial services industry while keeping the low income families out of the clutches of high cost alternative financial service providers allowing them to increase assets and become financially resilient.
