## Long description

Our mission is to work in creative ways to prevent homelessness and to provide housing for people in need. University congregational housing association (ucha) provided housing for families in need through sortun court, a 16-unit apartment building and the boathouse, a six-unit apartment building. Ucha owns, manages and maintains the affordable housing projects for families below 50% and 30% of median income as defined by hud. Ucha also leases and manages a single-family house, which provided rental housing for homeless and/or low income persons. In 2011 the association purchased a six bedroom home for youth aged out of foster care or otherwise homeless and provided housing to these persons.
