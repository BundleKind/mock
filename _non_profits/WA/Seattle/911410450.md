## Long description

Building changes believes everyone in washington can be stably housed. We strengthen the leaders, organizations and systems that make it possible. Grantmaking & evaluation - we lead the washington youth and families fund (wyff) which identifies, funds, and evaluates innovative programs that prevent and end homelessness. Created in 2004 by the washington state legislature, wyff funds model programs and innovative strategies that address the problems of homelessness both at a system and family level. In 2015, we granted funds to 27 organizations throughout washington state.
