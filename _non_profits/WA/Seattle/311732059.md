## Long description

To create exceptional theatrical productions that awaken the very best in children and teens. Bound children's theatre transforms the lives of children ages 5 - 18 through active participation in a dynamic theatre arts program that combines a fun and supportive atmosphere with professional standards. Children of all skill levels and backgrounds are challenged to develop their mental, physical, emotional, social, and creative potential through the joy and discipline of live theatre. Mainstage musical and summer programs served 1,500 children in 2014/2015, who performed musical theatre of professional standards for audiences totaling over 10,000. Skills developed in these programs include public speaking, memorization, dance, singing, acting, discipline and commitment to group goals.
