## Long description

Roots provides shelter and other essential services to homeless young adults. We build community, advocate for social justice, and foster dignity among low-income people. Young adult shelter: the shelter provides a safe, dry place to sleep, hot meals and hygiene facilities to homeless young adults seven nights each week. In addition, the shelter subcontracts with teen feed's street talk outreach program to provide access to counseling and case management services for all shelter guests. These case managers assist shelter guests in accessing health care, housing, employment training, addiction counseling and opportunities for continuing education. Roots is specifically designed to meet the needs of homeless young adults, and provides an integral piece of the continuum of care for homeless persons in king county. In 2014, roots provided 14,991 bed nights of shelter and served 647 unduplicated guests. In 2013, roots provided 15,004 bed nights of shelter and served 606 unduplicated guests.
