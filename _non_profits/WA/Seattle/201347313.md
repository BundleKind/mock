## Long description

Ileap renews and inspires social leaders and global citizens through integrated leadership programs that ignite hope and transformation in the world. Ileap global programs consist of our international fellowship, southeast asia leadership initiative (sali), and latin american leadership initiative (lali). All of our global programs are a long-term investment in community-based leadership in asia, africa, and latin america. Each program consists of up to 15 participants and ranges in length from 2 to 8 weeks. In 2015, after 8 years, we took a break from doing our international fellowship program and focused on lali and our work with our partners in latin america. We also conducted a 'releap' advanced training in el salvador for our graduates from the region. All together, 25 leaders were served in our global program in 2015, hailing from guatemala, mexico, haiti, nicaragua, honduras. The dominican republic and el salvador. In 2016 we will restart the international fellowship.
