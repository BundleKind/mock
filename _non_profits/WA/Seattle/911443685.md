## Long description

Withinreach makes the connections washington families need to be healthy. Food & health: withinreach connects families to health and food resources and benefits through our hotlines, web-tools or through our in-person outreach activities. Withinreach's bi-lingual call center staff are experts in health care resources and provide families with friendly, compassionate service through our three hotlines including washington state's apple health for kids hotline, the family health hotline, and the family food hotline. To complement our call center services, we offer comprehensive online resources for families, parenthelp123. Org, and pregnant and parenting teens, washingteenhelp. Org. Partnering with americorps, our service members conduct outreach and application assistance in-person in king and snohomish counties through our bridge to basics program.
