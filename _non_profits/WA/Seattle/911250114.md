Outreach to homeless youth. New horizons is a non-profit, multi-cultural christian ministry to homeless and street-involved young people in seattle, washington. New horizons ministries carries out their mission of helping homeless and street-involved young people by (1) connecting them to basic needs of food, clothing, hygiene, safety and rest, (2) engaging them in healthy relationships, a committed community of support, and personal and spiritual development, and (3) equipping them with life skills and job and educational opportunities for success away from the streets.
