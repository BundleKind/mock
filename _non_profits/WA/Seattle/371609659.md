## Long description

Equal opportunity schools' mission is to ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed in challenging high school courses. Closing the achievement gap:equal opportunity schools partners with high schools to find students missing from the most rigorous classes and change their life trajectories. We identify, enroll and support missing students in challenging college-preparatory courses. We boost their academic motivation and achievement, and their likelihood of going to and graduating from college.
