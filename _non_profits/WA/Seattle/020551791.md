## Long description

Sccs intentionally integrates child-centered, high quality, anti-bias early childhood education with effective business practices to create a stable organization that consistently helps young children reach their full potential. We serve all children with a commitment to ensuring that low income children have real opportunities at each center. We support children's home language and culture, honoring and integrating families as children's first and most important teacher. Sccs has a commitment and dedication to creating long term social change that provides equal educational opportunity and effective teaching for all children. In 2014-2015, our consortium of six child care centers served over 440 children from birth-5 and 30 school age children. The vast majority (95%) of children met or exceeded developmental milestones for their age. By the end of the school year, 98% of prek children demonstrated the skills necessary to be successful in kindergarten.
