To use our ecolabel and fishery certification program to contribute to the health of the world's oceans by recognizing and rewarding sustainable fishing practices, influencing the choices people make when buying seafood, and working with our partners to transform the seafood market to a sustainable basis. Commercial outreach - working with various elements of the seafood supply chain to help them become chain of custody certified so that they can buy and sell msc-certified sustainable seafood, and promote sustainable fishing practices in that way.
