## Long description

Seward park clay studio's mission is to promote the growth of the ceramic arts by providing a broad range of educational programs, events, and studio opportunities for artists, in a community clay arts facility. We provide classes and workshops for over 250 students. This includes many hundreds of hours of open studio time, where students have access to a fully equipped ceramic studio.
