## Long description

We inspire and empower youth to experience food in new ways through gardening, cooking, and eating together. Gardening and cooking summer camps - green plate special offers both a 3-day per week 6-week summer program and a 1 week full day camp for middle school youth. During these sessions youth participate and contribute to our growing and cooking program. Their days include a lunch they cook themselves, planting, tending, harvesting of vegetables and fruits, team building, art projects, field trips, guests speakers and best practices for sustainable food and community.
