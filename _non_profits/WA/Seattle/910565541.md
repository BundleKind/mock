Enriching, preserving, and sharing with others the danish culture, traditions, and values through programs and social outreach to elders, youth, children, and adults. We focus on five major program areas: contemporary issues, arts, education, families, and seniors. Encourage cultural awareness; provide information, assistance and recreation for the nw danish community and the general public.
