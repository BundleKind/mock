## Long description

Wphp's mission is to facilitate the rehabilitation of health care practitioners who have physical or mental conditions that could compromise public safety and to monitor their recovery. Wphp facilitated rehabilitation and provided monitoring services for 315 physicians and other health care practitioners who have physical or mental conditions that could compromise public safety. Wphp provided educational presentations to approximately 2000 health care practitioners, professional organizations, hospitals, and other health care facilities concerning safe delivery of health care services. Wphp maintained and monitored a database of health care practitioners in our state whom may need rehabilitation and monitoring in the future. Wphp provides assistance grants and fee waivers to clients needing financial assistance in order to participate in whph's programs and services. Wphp launched its wellness program in the fall of 2014 and facilitated wellness programming for 30 health care practitioners to enhance their health during that year.
