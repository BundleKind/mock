## Long description

Mission: jfs helps vulnerable individuals and families in the puget sound region achieve well-being, health and stability. Approach: jewish history and values guide our work; therefore, we provide effective services to people of all backgrounds and also have a responsibility to meet the particular needs of jewish individuals and families in the region. Aging in place services: provides services allowing clients to continue living in their home environment with personal care and homemaker services, including meal preparation and completing or assisting with errands. Professional care management services are available to clients and their families to assist in coordinating medical and other appointments. Geriatric care managers meet with families concerned about an aging loved one to explore options for receiving needed care and address barriers to implementing changes. Free services are also available to family caregivers, including financial assistance, housekeeping, errands and more.
