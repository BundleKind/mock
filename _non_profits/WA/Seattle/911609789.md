## Long description

Through the innovative use of technology, springwire connects people isolated by poverty to support, services, and opportunities. We help people in poverty, transition and homelessness rebuild their lives by connecting them to jobs, housing, information and hope. We do this by customizing and distributing communications technology via a national network of community based services.
