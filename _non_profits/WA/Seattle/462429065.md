## Long description

The primary focus is finding safe, loving homes for unwanted, neglected and/or abused animals. Rescuing the animals who have been in the shelters the longest and will die unless rescued. Securing a no-kill facility where rescued pets can be safely sheltered without the threat of euthanization until adoptive parents are found for the pets.
