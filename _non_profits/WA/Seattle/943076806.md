## Long description

Increase people's ability to meet their own food needs
  
  federation members are dedicated to enhancing the nutritional content of emergency food bags and increasing people's ability to meet their own food needs. Members work to provide for special dietary needs such as emergency food bags for the homeless, or for those with needs for infant food and supplies. Some member programs deliver food to the homebound. Clients are given access to job training programs, referrals to employment opportunities and other critical services. Some are educated on infant care, nutrition and parenting resources, while others receive access to gardens, seeds and training to plant and produce their own food.
