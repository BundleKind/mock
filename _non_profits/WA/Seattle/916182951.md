## Long description

Optimizing the quality of life for all people living with cancer by offering emotional support, financial advocacy and assistance, exercise, nutrition and artistic expression classes at no cost. Cancer lifeline provides comprehensive non-medical services without charge to optimize the quality of life for all people living with cancer: patients, family, friends, caretakers and co-workers. Through 13,058 service contracts, people accessed a range of services including: 24-hour emotional support and referrals via phone, financial advocacy and funds available in 16 western washington counties, hundreds of support group meetings, gentle exercise, nutrition and artistic expression classes. We have one free-standing site in seattle. Three area hospitals contract for our services. All services are open to the community. In addition, volunteers provided over $65,000 of donated services during the year.
