## Long description

Our motto and goal at bethany bear's preschool is 'learn to love, love to learn. ' we believe in surrounding the children in an atmosphere of love and protection. We believe then they are free to learn more about jesus' love and the world they live in. Our curriculum is created to pique the children's interest. We desire that they have fun exploring different aspects of the world god created for them. Our curriculum is not just based on bible characters and bible verses, though they are brought into our teaching. We believe that children learn more about god if they are taught to see him in everyday things and happenings. We do not have a special temple time set aside for the children; instead the children are introduced to the power of prayer and god's word at snack time. Our goal is to prepare the children for kindergarten in a christian, loving atmosphere, where the children learn to love themselves and each other as well. The school provided preschool education to 52 children. The school employed five teachers whose three-and-four-hour classes were offered two, three or five days per week, for the 10 months of the traditional school year.
