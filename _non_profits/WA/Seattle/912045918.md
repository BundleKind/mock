## Long description

Academic and leadership enrichment programs designed to prepare high-achieving low-income students of color for long term academic success and college graduation. Academic enrichment phase - we successfully recruited our 14th cohort of scholars this year, including students from renton, highline and seattle school districts. Meanwhile, cohort 12 completed their final summer in 2014 with 98% earning placement into independent schools or highly-capable public school programs. Cohort 13 completed their school year in 2014-15 achieving a 100% placement rate in college preparatory settings with 45% in public school programs and 55% earning placement at independent schools.
