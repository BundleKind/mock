## Long description

Listen and talk teaches children who are deaf or hard of hearing to communicate and learn through listening and spoken language. Listen and talk teaches children who are deaf and hard of hearing to communicate and learn through listening and spoken language. Features of listen and talk programs are: early intervention services for infants, preschool and prekindergarten classes,individual therapy and outside teacher consultations, the use of advanced hearing technology, blended classes that include children with hearing loss and children with normal hearing, collaborations with each child's team members including: audiologists, therapists, teachers and family members, partnerships with agencies and school districts, highly qualified staff providing quality educational programs. In the last year alone, we served a combined 281 children through these important programs.
