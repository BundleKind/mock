## Long description

Wwf is a large scale collective giving organization that educates, inspires and increases the number of women committed to philanthropy in order to strengthen community and demonstrate the impact that can result from informed, focused grant-making. Pooled grant making: wwf makes five major grants of $100,000 each, totaling $500,000 to regional nonprofit organizations, one in each of these areas: arts, education, environment, health, and human services. 70-80 members invest more than 2,000 hours annually in the grant-making process, participating in a rigorous review procedure with the grantees ultimately selected by a vote of the membership. Merit grants totaling $10,000 are awarded to the five runner-up organizations.
