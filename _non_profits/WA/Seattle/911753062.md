## Long description

Bike works builds sustainable communities by educating youth and promoting bicycling. For nearly two decades we've worked to educate and empower youth, and make bicycling accessible and affordable to the seattle community. Youth programs - education and empowerment:bike works youth programs serve a diverse group of young people in programs and partnerships from throughout the seattle metro area with a concentration on southeast seattle. In 2014, 778 youth learned bike mechanics and safe riding skills. Youth rode over 7,100 combined miles in our summer riding camps and school year programs. Youth completed over 5,484 hours of community service.
