## Long description

Nami washington's mission is to improve the quality of life for all those affected by mental illnesses. We do this by providing a statewide, unifying voice of advocacy and coordinating the delivery of support, education, and research. Support & outreach - nami washington's array of support and outreach efforts are focused on educating washingtonians about mental illness, treatment, support services and recovery. In fy2014-2015, nami washington hosted the 11th annual nami washington walk where over 1000 people gathered in kirkland, wa for the state's largest public event to celebrate recovery, advocate for a more robust mental health treatment and support system, and combat the stigma associated with mental illness. The annual state conference brought over 150 members and providers together for three days of educational workshops focused on all aspects of mental health treatment, recovery, and system operations.
