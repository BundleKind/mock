## Long description

As washington state's flagship nonprofit dedicated to the humanities, hw's work brings people together to learn about their unique pasts and shared present, promotes respect for other perspectives, encourages community dialogue and nurtures relationships that enable us to move toward a more prosperous future. By acting as a catalyst and facilitator, hw supports and partners with a wide network of communities, organizations and individuals. Together hw and its partners provide low or no cost, high quality cultural and educational programs in communities small and large across washington. Family reading - children's books aren't always child's play. They can inspire important philosophical discussions of topics such as fairness, greed, courage, and compassion. Humanities washington's prime time family reading program encourages shared connections around books and reading, boosting long-term academic achievement and lasting connections with local libraries. 656 children and families participated in 16 family reading programs during 2015 at libraries in monroe, marysville, kennewick, pasco, richland, ritzville, airway heights, clarkston, cheney, spokane valley, fall city, issaquah, north bend, and tacoma.
