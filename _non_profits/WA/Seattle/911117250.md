## Long description

To provide a resource of knowledge and expertise to strengthen the work of organizations and programs that promote and enhance the welfare, health and safety of children, individuals, families and communities. Encouraging/facilitating/training adoptive and foster parents-we host the northwest adoption exchange, which finds permanent adoptive homes for children in foster care in alaska, idaho, oregon and washington. We maintain a website: www. Nwae. Org, through which we recruit prospective families. We also support a regional media network of newspaper and television features on waiting children. Our efforts result in thousands of inquires from interested families and individuals and the placement of hundreds of children every year. This service is funded by private donations and by the states of alaska, idaho, oregon and washington. We are responsible for recruitment, retention, support and training of alaskan foster and adoptive parents through our alaska center for resource families program. And we conduct the oregon post adoption resource center, which provides support and training to oregon's adoptive families.
