## Long description

The trust is dedicated to the conservation of the snow leopard and its mountain habitat by working in partnership with individuals and institutions in central asia, and through educating the public about the snow leopard, its habitat, protection measures and conservation strategies. Conservation of the endangered snow leopard and its mountain ecosystem: in 2014 the snow leopard trust worked with more than 16,000 people in 2000 households in 50 communities to implement programs that not only protect wild snow leopards but also improve the quality of life of the participating communities. Our three primary programs were livestock insurance, livestock vaccination, and a handicraft program called snow leopard enterprises. As part of these programs herders signed conservation contracts in which they agreed to protect snow leopards and their key prey. The snow leopard trust also continued its role as the lead technical advisor to the global snow and ecosystem protection program (gslep) developed out of the 2013 global snow leopard forum. In 2014, as part of the gslep, the snow leopard trust gained agreement from governments of all 12 snow leopard range countries towards increasing protection across 23 landscapes in order for them to adequately support more than 2000 snow leopards by 2020.
