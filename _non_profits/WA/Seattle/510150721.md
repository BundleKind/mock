## Long description

To make known the gifts of people with developmental disabilities revealed through mutually transforming relationships. To engage in our diverse cultures, working together toward a more human society. To foster community that is inspired by the core values in our founding story and responds to the changing needs of our members
  
  l'arche operates three group homes and a small day program for adults with developmental disabilities in seattle, wa, serving 13 people with disabilities. People with developmental disabilities (core members) and their caregivers(assistants) live together in our three homes. Our homes, angeline, noah and shuinota are within a walking distance of one another and close to a business/commercial area(including grocery stores, restaurants, drug stores, and some small shops). Our assistants come from all over the united states and from all over the world. The assistants receive a small stipend and room and board in exchange for their services. We also receive much support and fellowship from associate members, volunteers from schools and colleges in the greater seattle area.
