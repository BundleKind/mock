## Long description

The primary purpose of the trust is to secure, preserve, and steward threatened farmland in washington, to ensure that generations of local farmers productively farm it using sustainable, organic growing methods. Farmland preservation program: the primary purpose of the trust is to secure, preserve, and steward threatened farmland in the northwest, to ensure that generations of local farmers productively farm it using sustainable, organic growing methods. The trust takes its mission one step further than most land trusts by working to place farmers on the property, actively producing food for the local community. A primary method for the trust to protect irreplaceable agricultural land and preserve local farming communities is by purchase of agricultural conservation easements. These remove development rights and guarantee the land will be actively farmed organically in perpetuity. Another primary method for the trust is to acquire threatened farmland and lease it to a farmer.
