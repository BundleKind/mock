## Long description

Pscs was founded in 1994 on the belief that young people thrive when provided a supportive environment, are encouraged to pursue their passions, and are guided in following their intrinsic motivation to learn. The central educational purpose of pscs is to help young people discover and follow their passions while becoming thoughtful, sincere, and respectful global citizens. Pscs students learn to become self-directed and develop a deep sense of self. Our program is built on helping them discover their strengths and passions, and transform these into meaningful achievements. During the 2014-2015 school year, fifty students attended pscs.
