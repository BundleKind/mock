## Long description

Land hope life was formed to support the exempt purposes of agros international, to help break the cycle of poverty among poor farming families through holistic development and land ownership. One of the primary activities of land hope life is to hold land in stewardship for eventual transfer to poor families who are working their way out of poverty. Purchased two parcels of land in nicaragua for $826,001 with funds granted by agros international. Held additional land in nicaragua for homes and farmland, serving a total of approximately 225 poor rural families.
