## Long description

Oneamerica advances the fundamental principles of democracy and justice at the local, state and national levels by building power within immigrant communities in collaboration with key allies. Oneamerica organized and built power with immigrant communities through community base groups in 8 locations across washington state, directly engaging hundreds of immigrants and reaching thousands of members through personal networks and email & social media. In 2014 we hosted numerous events in support of comprehensive immigration reform, administrative relief, and the implementation of daca, reaching hundreds of immigrant and refugee community members. Since the president's announcement in november 2014, our outreach on administrative relief has reached more than 1,000 potentially eligible individuals at events in vancouver, mount vernon, tacoma, kent, burien, white center, sunnyside, walla walla, pasco, royal city, bellevue and others. The washington new americans program served 1,956 clients with citizenship services in 2014, completing 930 n-400 applications for citizenship. There were 315 participants in our financial literacy classes. We helped thousands more with citizenship assistance through a network of organizations across washington state.
