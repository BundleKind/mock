## Long description

University cooperative school is a community of children, families, and teachers. Together, we create an environment that is both vital and caring, in which children deepen their love of learning, build confidence in their voices, and come to value their own gifts and those of others. We respect each child's unique nature, and foster in our children a strong sense of belonging -- the knowledge that they are accepted and valued for who they are. At the same time, we prize and hold before them a vision of their highest potential. The school enrolled 84 students in grades k-5. The school is managed by its members, which are parents of the students who attend the school.
