## Long description

We provide k-12 informal science education through authentic laboratory experiences. Our mission is simple: expose. Hook. Mentor. Expose students to a broad spectrum of careers through hands-on experience at a young age (since you never know when an inspired moment might make a students pathway clear). Hook by treating every student as capable in an authentic environment doing sophisticated labs based on modern scenarios, taught by professionals in the medical/scientific industry. Mentor high school and college-age interns as they move into the next phase of their academic lives. During the 2015-2016 academic year we were able to provide programming to over 2,500 students, created three new modules, an enrichment course, and offered two summer camps on college campuses. 80% of the programs consisted of the heart module. The remaining 20% included birth, babies & biotech, forensic anthropology, anatomy of movement, evolution & adaption, sports medicine enrichment and summer camps.
