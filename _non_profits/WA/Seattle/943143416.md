Mid puget sound fisheries enhancement group (mid sound feg) seeks to conserve and restore self-sustaining salmonid populations through close involvement with diverse community interests. Habitat restoration: designed and implemented stream restoration projects to benefit fish, including replacing undersized culverts, planting native vegetation along streams, removing invasive vegetation, and improving in-stream habitat (such as wood and gravel) for fish use. Engaged volunteers in fish monitoring education and restoration. Monitored progress of past projects using parameters such as planting progress and juvenile out-migration.
