## Long description

Women's enterprises international reaches across cultures to transform lives and communities by partnering with women's groups, empowering and equipping women to break the cycle of poverty and live into their god-given potential. Rural women's micro-savings and access to clean water, kenya: wei's largest program is in kenya where wei facilitates the formation of rural women's groups, equipping members through training and matching grants to undertake projects that tackle the major contributors to poverty in their families and communities. In fy2015 these projects focused on access to clean safe water, income generation and micro-savings. Wei matching grants for 26 rainwater-harvesting systems combined with over 240 rain-harvesting systems funded by the kenya groups' income generation and micro-savings projects brought clean, safe water to 266 new families (over 1,440 additional children and adults). Wei facilitated leadership development for the eight-member field staff and leaders of over 40 active women's groups. No revenue is derived from this program.
