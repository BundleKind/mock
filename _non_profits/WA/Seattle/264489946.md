## Long description

Sage bionetworks is a strategic research organization with a mission to coordinate and link academic and commercial biomedical researchers, patients and citizens through a commons that represents a new paradigm for genomics intellectual property, researcher cooperation and contributor evolved resources. This mission has several interdependent themes, including: conducting research on network models of disease; building the computational platform for the commons; and activating public engagement. Research: the synapse platform is an open access environment for collaborative research on biological network models and their application to problems of human disease and biology. Sage related research communities using synapse include: the amp ad (alzheimer's disease) knowledge portal, an nia funded repository and workspace for multi-omic data; the cancer genome atlas (tcga) pan-cancer consortium, engaging 30 organizations to perform integrative analysis on data from 12 different tumor types; the colorectal cancer consortium of researchers from15 academic, pharmaceutical, and non-profit partners; the commonmind consortium bringing together large scale brain sample collections to generate and analyze genomic data related to neuropsychiatric disease; and the nhlbi funded progenitor cell biology consortium. Research also includes open computational challenges conducted with ibm dream and hosted on synapse. Designed and run by researchers, these challenges invite participants to propose solutions to questions about systems biology and translation medicine -fostering collaboration and open research communities. In 2014, the 8. 5 and 9. 0 challenge seasons included the somatic mutation calling challenge, the gene essentiality prediction challenge, and challenges on rheumatoid arthritis, alzheimer's disease and acute myeloid leukemia.
