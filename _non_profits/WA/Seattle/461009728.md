## Long description

Enlearn is dedicated to reducing the achievement gap for k-12 students by making school curricula adapt to the needs of each unique child, creating personalized learning paths for students, and providing real-time performance feedback for their teachers through the enlearn platform, an adaptive software program designed to optimize the entire learning ecosystem including students, teachers, and parents. Enlearn platform: further development of the enlearn platform, the adaptive generative software platform designed to optimize engagement and mastery for every student, continued during the year. The enlearn platform was field tested and improved over the course of the year and showed more progress for all students using it than those using traditional paper curricula. Enlearn also began consulting with other educational organizations and courseware providers to make their products generative and adaptable to students needs.
