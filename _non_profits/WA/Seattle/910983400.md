## Long description

Nwwp owns and manages the goldmyer hot springs property as a wilderness conservation area. The property is available for day use and camping by youth groups and the general public. Nwwp focuses on the conservation and management of the goldmyer hot springs. We have about 4,000 visitors per year, including a varying number of scouts and school groups.
