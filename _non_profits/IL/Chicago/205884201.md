## Long description

The primary purpose of casel is to establish social and emotional learning (sel) as an essential part of education, from preschool through high school. Casel defines sel as the process by which children and adults develop social and emotional competencies. Sel programs enhance emotional, cognitive and behavioral competencies so that developmental tasks can be handled effectively and ethically. The programs also establish environmental settings and resources that foster knowledgeable, responsible, and caring young people who achieve positive academic, health, and citizenship outcomes
  
  casel continued to build school district-level support for social and emotional learning (sel) through its collaborating districts initiative (cdi). Casel provided professional development and implementation planning support services to the cohort 1 cdi sites: anchorage, austin, and cleveland and cohort 2: chicago, nashville, oakland, sacramento, and washoe. Casel provided professional development to these districts and assisted in the creation of a comprehensive three-year sel implementation plan for each district. Additionally, casel provided professional development, consulting and coaching to districts in dupage county, illinois, assisting them in implementing district-wide sel.
