## Long description

Metropolitan family services' mission is to provide and mobilize the services needed to strengthen families and communities. Emotional wellness: we encourage healthy and productive lives. Through supportive, caring counseling, individuals and families in any phase of life are empowered to better handle life's challenges. Our mental health services provide psychiatric evaluation, case management and crisis intervention to help children and adults with chronic mental illness recover and be productive. We also offer assistance for older adults and their caregivers to meet the unique concerns of this stage of life. Compassionate violence prevention programs alleviate the impact of community or domestic violence. And specialized veterans' services help returning soldiers and their families reintegrate into civilian life and reconnect with one another. Number of clients served - 22,703
