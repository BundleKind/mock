## Long description

Hret is principally organized to assist health care organizations and the communities they serve to improve the efficiency, quality & accessibility of health care services by conducting applied research and demonstration projects & disseminating results through education, publications, & other media. Quality/cost/disparities: hret conducts management research to provide operational advice on improving quality, reducing costs, and eliminating disparities. Numerous research projects worked with hospitals nationally to reduce infections and to improve safety culture scores. In addition, hret provides hospitals with tools and training materials compiled from various surveys conducted to help educate healthcare professionals. Examples include the comprehensive unit-based safety program (cusp), which transforms care and patient safety at the unit level by improving culture, with support from the agency for healthcare research and quality.
