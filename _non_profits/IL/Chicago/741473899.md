## Long description

The mission of the american theological library association is to foster the study of theology and religion by enhancing the development of theological and religious studies libraries and librarianship. Atla supports its membership by creating the resources for scholarly research in theology and religion that libraries offer to the students and faculty they serve. Librarians are provided with professional development opportunities that include an annual conference, workshops and webinars, grants for continuing education, and members-only publications.
