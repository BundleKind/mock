## Long description

Casa central transforms lives and strengthens communities, with a special focus on hispanics. Our network of social services propels a diverse population of all ages toward self-sufficiency and a higher quality of life. Children and youth services: inner-city hispanic children and youth endure a multitude of challenges including poverty, violence, low educational expectations, and inadequate access to technology. Through full-day child development and after school programming, casa central's programs for children and youth focus on the importance of healthy physical, emotional and intellectual child development. Emphasis is placed on the role of parents in the development process and the importance of building self-esteem, confidence and a positive self-image. These services include head start services and day care, and programs for school age children, youth and adolescents.
