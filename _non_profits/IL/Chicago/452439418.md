## Long description

To promote closed-loop food production and sustainable economic development through education and research. Plant chicago, nfp will provide educational opportunities for sustainability professionals, college students, schoolchildren, and the public to learn about a wide range of topics, from energy and efficiency in buildings to growing techniques. Plant chicago, nfp aims to educate as many people as possible about the plant's model of closing waste and resource loops. Plant chicago provides pathways for people to get exposure to-and participate in-the innovations we are piloting at the plant, a former meatpacking facility repurposed into an urban food hub. Through facility tours, volunteer programs, educational workshops, and open source documentation, people can learn to replicate new models of vertical farming, smart building technology and energy production.
