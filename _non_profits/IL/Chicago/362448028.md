## Long description

The mission of the physicians, staff and board of directors of the organization is to provide compassionate and high quality healthcare services to meet the needs of the patients and communities we serve. Jackson park hospital foundation provides inpatient and outpatient medical care and behavioral medicine services to chicago's south side communities regardless of the patients ability to pay. Jackson park hospital serves a economically challenged community with high rates of foreclosures, unemployment, violence and some of the worst health indices in the city of chicago. Jackson park hospital itself is challenged to stay viable in such a poorly resourced area. However, jackson park hospital works to deploy its limited resources in ways that most appropriately meets the needs of our community.
