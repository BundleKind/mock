## Long description

Because we are a multi-faceted agency, our mission may manifest differently at different programs, but it is the shared goal that fuels the agency. Carc industries offers programs for people of all ages and abilities spanning the city of chicago. We provide job training and job placement services. Carc industries provides work opportunities to individuals who are at least 18 years of age and who have a diagnosed developmental disability. Work opportunities are provided under programs funded by the illinois department of human services. Carc industries connects people to community-based jobs and supported employment. If necessary our job coaches work side by side with our clients until particular skills are mastered. At seven work centers throughout the city, subcontract work and products are manufactured for a variety of customers nationwide. At one of our work centers, we operate a pillow production plant that produces over half a million pillows annually for major airlines, hotels and medical centers.
