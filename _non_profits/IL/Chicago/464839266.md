## Long description

American friends of midrasha tzionit (afmt) operates as an educational network for jewry from the former soviet union and anyone who wants to learn more about jewish history, culture and religion, regardless of affiliation. Tekhelet is a rigorous camp program that builds strong jewish identities, imparts jewish knowledge, and creates young leaders. The tekhelet youth camp is an educational project, which holds sessions in both summer and winter. The tekhelet participants are carefully selected as future community leaders, and leadership training courses begin prior to the program. Tekhelet teaches its participants not only leadership, but leadership through jewish values.
