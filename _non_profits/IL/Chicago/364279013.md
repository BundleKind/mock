## Long description

The chicago public education fund (the fund) is building a critical mass of great public schools in chicago by investing in talented principals and enabling educator teams to reinvent classroom learning in ways that dramatically improve student outcomes. Innovative educator network - the fund continues to support principals and their educator teams as they use innovative, personalized learning models to accelerate student learning, improve teacher practice, and move their public schools into the 21st century. In 2014, this included work to expand the organization's inaugural summer design program (sdp), which enabled 40 public school teams to take part in a summer-long workshop series designed to help them implement small scale innovations within their schools and classrooms. Additionally, the fund provided small grants to 23 of the sdp schools to support implementation of their innovations. The fund also provided support to the breakthrough schools chicago initiative, a competitive grant program to catalyze the development of transformational, 21st century school models that enhance personalized learning and accelerate student outcomes. In 2014, seven schools were provided one-year planning grants through breakthrough schools.
