## Long description

Chicago house and social service agency (chicago house) was formed in 1985 to provide housing and supportive services to hiv-affected families and individuals, who may also be impacted by poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness. (see sched. O) all chicago house services are provided without discrimination and are explicitly designed to guide people towards wholeness and self-sufficiency. Residential housing - the family support program offers housing, case management, and other supportive services to 18 hiv/aids affected families that include over 40 dependent children. Designed for families facing homelessness and poverty in addition to hiv/aids, the program works intensively with both the parents and the children. The supportive living program is a 16-unit group living facility in chicago's west town neighborhood, which provides the 'first step' of housing and supportive services to adults living with hiv/aids who come directly from the streets or the shelter system; this facility is staffed 24 hours. The independent living program is a 24-unit apartment building in uptown, providing permanent housing to adults living with hiv/aids in need of affordable housing with supportive services available to meet intermittent needs.
