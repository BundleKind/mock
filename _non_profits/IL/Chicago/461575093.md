## Long description

The mission of the chicago southwest development corporation is to create self-sustaining communities throughout chicago's underserved neighborhoods, to enrich the lives of families through non-traditional education, recreation, and health and wellness programs, and to enhance social service programs that specifically meet the needs of each individual community. Chicago southwest development corporation is developing a multipurpose campus on 22 acres called the focal point community campus (the 'campus'). The campus will reside on three lots at 31st street and kedzie avenue in southwest chicago, including the former site of the washburne trade school. The proposed one million square-foot complex will offer a range of retail, wellness, education, arts, and recreation elements focused on the complete well-being of community members, instead of purely on one element, such as health care. Saint anthony hospital, a related tax-exempt organization, will serve as a tenant of the campus and will continue to provide emergency and medical care that turns no one away, regardless of ability to pay. There will also be an outpatient and specialty clinic to meet a wide range of rehabilitative and health maintenance needs.
