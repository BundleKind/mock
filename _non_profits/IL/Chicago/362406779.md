## Long description

The beverly area planning association (bapa) was founded in 1947 and restructured in 1972 as a not-for-profit illinois corporation. It serves as the central organization for community organizations in the beverly hills/morgan park communities and thereby provides a forum for the discussion of concerns common to the area. The association coordinates and implements comprehensive plans designed to improve the community through programs in housing, education, economic development, marketing, and special events. Bapa also publishes a free monthly newspaper. The organization sponsors various community programs involving housing, commercial economic development including improvement to the economic viability of the neighborhood, education, seniors, safety, and public relations withing the community. The organization publishes a community newspaper, the villager, which is distributed free of charge in the community.
