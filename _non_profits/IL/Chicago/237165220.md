## Long description

Presenting the living christ, primarily to unchurched inner city children and youth, discipling and integrating them into a local church. Clubs, outings, and activities: we run after-school programs that are focused on providing an alternative to children and youth as well as teaching them the word of god. We have an average of 265 children per week that attend our various clubs. At the clubs, the children are given a chance to play games, do crafts, and learn about the bible. During the year we also provide various special events for the kids that consist of special days in our building or taking kids to events. We had over 1300 children attend the special events in our building where we informed them about how they could become involved in our programs that we run. We also had an event we took the kids to once a month which averaged 53 children per event. Each of these are focused on spending time with children and providing a fun experience for them.
