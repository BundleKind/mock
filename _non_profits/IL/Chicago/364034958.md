The arab american action network (aaan) strives to strengthen the arab community in the chicago area by building its capacity to be an active agent for positive social change. As a grassroots nonprofit, our strategies include community organizing, advocacy, education, providing social services, leadership development, cultural outreach and forging productive relationships with other communities. Our vision is for a strong arab american community whose members have the power to make decisions about actions and policies that affect their lives and have access to a range of social, political, cultural and economic opportunities in a context of equity and social justice. Adult education, youth programs, social services, meditation and crisis intervention, cultural competency training, leadership development and community organization programs.
