## Long description

Resolution systems institute (rsi) is a unique non-profit organization whose mission is to strengthen justice by enhancing court alternative dispute resolution (adr) systems through expertise in program development, research and resources. Mediation programs - rsi works with courts to develop, improve and administer adr programs as an adjunct to traditional litigation. There programs free courts to focus on cases that require judicial attention, while enabling disputing parties to reach resolutions faster, at a lower cost and in a more satisfying manner. Services vary by program, but typically include reaching out to mediation proponents, providing expert guidance for stakeholder meetings, drafting or refining court rules, providing sample forms, and designing program monitoring systems. In some programs, rsi also provides specialized training of neutrals, on-site program administration, and monitoring and evaluation services. Rsi partners with courts, attorneys, mediators and other community members to develop mediation programs for major civil litigation, including foreclosure; small claims, including landlord/tenant; family, including child custody and financial issues; child protection; and criminal and juvenile cases. Rsi is currently conducting foreclosure mediation programs in four illinois counties: kane, lake: winnebago and boone.
