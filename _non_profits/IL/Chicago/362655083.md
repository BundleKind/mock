## Long description

To invest in people and property through the development, maintenance, and improvement of quality mixed-income housing and related supportive services for persons of very low and moderate income in the north town area. Upward bound provides fundamental support to participants in their preparation for college entrance. The program provides opportunities for participants to succeed in their pre-college performance and ultimately in their higher education pursuits. Upward bound serves: high school students from low-income families; high school students from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor's degree; and low-income, first-generation military veterans who are preparing to enter post-secondary education. The goal of upward bound is to increase the rate at which participants complete secondary education and enroll in and graduate from institutions of post-secondary education.
