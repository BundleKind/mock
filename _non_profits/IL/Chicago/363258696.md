Ymca of the usa (y-usa) is the national resource office for the nation's 2,700 ys, which strengthen community by nurturing the potential of kids, promoting healthy living for all and fostering social responsibility. Youth development: nurturing the potential of children and teens children from low-income families often start school unprepared.

' the y's achievement gap signature programs are designed to support the cognitive, physical, and social-emotional development of youth while improving their academic outcomes via early learning readiness, summer learning, and afterschool learning.
