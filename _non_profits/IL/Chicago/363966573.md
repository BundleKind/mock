## Long description

Accion chicago is an alternative lending organization dedicated to providing credit and other business services to small business owners who do not have access to traditional sources of financing. By encouraging the economic self-reliance of microentrepreneurs throughout the chicagoland area, accion chicago strives to help businesses and communities grow. Many of accion's clients do not have access to traditional bank loans. The small size of their loan request and limited credit history regularly make them ineligible for conventional financing and unable to obtain the credit they need to grow their businesses. Accion chicago provides the credit and training necessary to help small business owners increase their incomes, create new jobs and strengthen their communities. The organization makes loans to small business owners who are committed to their business, who may not have access to traditional sources of financing. Loans range from $500 to $50,000 with loan terms up to 60 months. Accion also offers free technical assistance and advice to small emerging and existing businesses.
