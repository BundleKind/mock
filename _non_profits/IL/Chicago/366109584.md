## Long description

The chicago bar foundation brings chicago's legal community together to improve access to justice for people in need and make the legal system more fair and efficient for everyone. Made the court system more user-friendly and accessible for those in need, particularly those without lawyers. The cbf continued to play a lead role in the circuit court of cook county's mortgage foreclosure mediation program, which helped thousands of people facing foreclosure reach the best resolution for their particular cases. In addition, the cbf continued its leadership and support for over ten advice desks in the state and federal courts and in the city's department of administrative hearings as well as several innovative court-based pro bono projects. The cbf expanded illinois justicecorps, an innovative program through which students serve as guides to make courts across illinois more welcoming and less intimidating for people without lawyers.
