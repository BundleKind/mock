## Long description

Moneythink expands economic opportunity in the united states by equipping urban youth to believe in themselves, navigate the financial decisions of adulthood, and achieve financial prosperity. Moneythink gets young people excited about making smart financial decisions and starts them down the path toward economic success - in turn, generating a financial ripple effect through families and entire communities. Moneythink mentors deliver the moneythink program once per week, at the partner location, over the course of one academic year. Moneythink aims to service each classroom with a mentor-to-student ratio of 5-to-1 or less. While moneythink often works with high schools, programs can also be held in community centers, youth centers, homeless shelters, public libraries, and any other venue where high school students congregate. In 2013-2014, moneythink taught a year-long program (24 weeks) during which volunteers go into at-risk communities and teach financial capability across four areas: spending money mindfully, saving money, using financial products safely, and earning money.
