## Long description

The children's surgical foundation ('the foundation or 'csf') is dedicated to providing outstanding pediatric surgical services to our patients incorporating family-centered care, comprehensive research, and the highest quality specialized education. The foundation is at the forefront of pediatric surgical care, specializing in nine surgical disciplines and a number of multidisciplinary programs. The foundation has a reputation for the finest quality care, superb teaching, and ground-breaking research. The latest advances in surgical treatments and state-of-the-art technology, coupled with a spirit of compassion and more years of experience than any other pediatric surgical group in the midwest creates the vital difference to our patients and their families: cardiovascular-thoracic surgery; neurosurgery; ophthalmology; orthopedic surgery; otolaryngology; pediatric surgery; plastic surgery; transplant surgery; urology. In addition, 35-45% of the patients served by the foundation are covered by medicaid. The shortfall of the reimbursement versus the actual surgical costs are absorbed by the foundation as a benefit to the community.
