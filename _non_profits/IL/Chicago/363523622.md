## Long description

Each year marwen provides visual art courses, college planning and career development programs free of charge
  
  studio programs- free studio art courses for 6th through 12th graders are at the heart of marwen's mission. Marwen has more than 1,600 annual student enrollments across 100 studio courses in a wide range of media, such as painting, drawing, photography, fashion, and more. These rigorous after-school or weekend courses are taught by professional working artists in marwen's six state-of-the-art studios and include all materials at no cost to the student. Marwen does not require students to have previous art-making experience, and at the end of each term, students' work is exhibited in marwen's gallery spaces.
