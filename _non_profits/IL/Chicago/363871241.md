Girl scouts also engages girls in financially challenged communities by providing facilitated, donor-supported programs to ensure all girls explore a wide range of topics and opportunities including stem (science, technology, engineering and math), healthy living, business, arts and culture, and the environment. The organization provided activities to 55,440 girls and 21,381 adults in troop/group settings located in greater chicago and northwest indiana.
