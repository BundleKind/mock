## Long description

Our mission is to establish a safe, nurturing environment where youth and young parents can be positively influenced to progressively increase their academic ability, economic development, social awareness, health awareness, and natural creative talents, through enhanced academic tutoring, occupational training, life coaching, healthy lifestyle, fine arts instruction, and college preparation. We provided job readiness training for over 80 youth and 20 adults who worked to improve their communities by doing community outreach in which they trained youth, peers, and adults in the englewood community on mental health, youth living with trauma, how to deal with stress and other violence prevention messages.
