## Long description

Breakthrough urban ministries (breakthrough) was formed in 1992 to meet the physical, emotional, mental, social and spiritual needs of people in the urban setting. Breakthrough seeks to demonstrate the compassion of christ by partnering with those affected by poverty to build connections, develop skills & open doors of opportunity. In chicago's east garfield park, where disinvestment has left the neighborhood devoid of opportunity and full of broken dreams, breakthrough is restoring the broken networks of youth and families and empowering adults in the community to achieve self-sufficiency and break the cycle of poverty. Homeless intervention (homeless adults)homeless intervention includes: (1) a daytime drop-in center for homeless adults, (2) a robust transitional housing program, and (3) permanent supportive housing. The goal of this service area is to move guests from crisis to stability and on to contributing to a healthy west side of chicago. These three core areas are enhanced by critical wraparound services, including workforce development, legal aid, and on-site behavioral and medical health care programs. Each year, breakthrough serves in excess of 1,400 homeless individuals.
