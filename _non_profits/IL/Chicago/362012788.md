## Long description

See schedule o. Geriatric services mission: through the functions of its two divisions, bh&mh is faithful to its non-profit, faith-based mission and continuing commitment as a provider of quality, compassionate medical, behavioral, social, and spiritual services for seniors and vulnerable adults of all ages. Its mission is to provide exceptional care, and it strives for the highest level of client satisfaction. Its services include independent- and supportive-living services, acute medical and ambulatory health needs, and ancillary programs. Individualized care plans are developed for each resident/patient, ensuring services meet the gamut of needs so common to the elderly and other vulnerable adults. Many adults who rely on bh&mh for their care arrive with limited resources and may have outlived family and friends. Care is made available regardless of ability to pay and, in many cases, is directly subsidized by bh&mh (see detail). Staff representing a broad range of professional disciplines ensure that, as medical and housing needs are met, so, too, are the needs for social interactions with peers and through inter-generational exchanges; opportunities for expression of religious beliefs; and opportunities, when appropriate, to contribute of themselves to others as volunteers.
