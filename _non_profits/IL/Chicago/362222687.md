## Long description

To promote healthy lungs and fight lung disease through research, advocacy, and education. Lung health programs: reduce the burden of chronic disease (especially asthma, lung cancer, and copd). We use health educators and other trained staff/volunteers to educate communities about how they can address lung health disparities and educate individuals about how to manage their lung disease. Currently, our programs and projects include: fight asthma now (for youth/teens), asthma management (for caregivers), asthma-friendly childcare project (for early childcare providers), addressing asthma in northern lake county project, copd initiative including our living better together copd conference, healthy lungs initiative, and radon awareness efforts among others.
