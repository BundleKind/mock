## Long description

Educational services, training, student housing
  
  the john paul ii newman foundation, works in close concert with the archdiocese of chicago as it continued to in 2014 with the multi-year procedures required toward the goal of building a catholic student residence hall at the physical location of 1352 s. Union st. , chicago, in proximity to the university of illinois-chicago campus. In the normal course of such a capital project, the board of directors performed significant non-compensated due dilligence as to vetting and engaging the services of reputable professional fundraising consultants who initially performed a campaign development study to determine that the necessary funds can be raised by implementng a two phase process. The foundation board and management have continued their efforts in securing pledges and activities required to sustain the initial stages of the project during 2014 as there was an unexpected zoning delay which occurred due to changes in the city of chicago ward boundaries changing from one local alderman to another and the retirement of an alderman.
