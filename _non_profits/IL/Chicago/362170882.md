## Long description

Norwood crossing enhances the independence and well being of older adults; we provide older adults with a continuum of services and programs that are responsive to the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of the individual. We maintain a comfortable, secure environment that promotes dignity and self worth. A total of 86,470 days of care were provided to 557 different residents in 2014. This includes 546 days of charity care ( care provided at no cost) and 27,209 days covered by medicaid. The daily reimbursement received for a medicaid resident is $62. 00 to $82. 00 less than the daily cost of providing care. This care included long term stays in skilled nursing, assisted living at varying levels and short term post hospital rehab care. Services provided include: physical , occupational and speech therapy , assistance with activities of daily living (bathing , dressing, eating, grooming and toileting) skilled nursing services (including wound care and disease management) , laundry and housekeeping services, exercise programs, art and music therapy , religious services and educational programs including a brain fitness program.
