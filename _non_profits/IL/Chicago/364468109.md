## Long description

The foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation dedicated to providing housing-related assistance to victims and their families in disaster situations affecting the united states of america and its territories. During 2015, grants were distributed to assist to victims of four disaster situations. The amounts collected for specific disastrous events were promptly distributed to provide timely assistance. The foundation works directly with state and local realtor associations to provide financial assistance for disaster relief efforts organized in their areas.
