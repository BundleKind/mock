## Long description

Kaleidoscope's mission is to serve abused and neglected children and their families - unconditionally - through individualized, family-centered, community-focused care. Kaleidoscope's vision is for every child to have a chance to lead an independent, self-sufficient, productive and happy life. The individual treatment program (itp) provides specialized foster care for children to more closely approximate a normal living situation, as opposed to a more restrictive setting.
