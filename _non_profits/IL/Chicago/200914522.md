## Long description

The organization works with housing opportunities for women (a 501(c)(3) organization) to develop and operate affordable housing for disadvantaged and homeless individuals. The organization owns and maintains a building designed for individuals with disabilities, both with and without families, whose disabilities prevent them from obtaining independent permanent housing. These disabilities may include chronic substance abuse, mental illness, dual diagnosis, or a developmental disability.
