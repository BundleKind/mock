## Long description

To protect children and strengthen families. In-home and out-of-home placement services: one hope united offers placement services when risk to a child from abuse and neglect is so great and the family situation is so deteriorated that the child must be removed from his or her home. We served more than 1,770 children through placement services in fy15, with the majority of these children receiving foster care services. In foster care, we provide case management services with the child while working to strengthen the biological family so that the child may safely return home.
