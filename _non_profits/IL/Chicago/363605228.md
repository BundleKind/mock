## Long description

To cultivate harmony among the world's religious and spiritual communities and foster their engagement with the world and its guiding institutions in order to achieve a just, peaceful and sustainable world. The vision of the council for a parliament of the world's religions is of a just, peaceful and sustainable world in which:*religious and spiritual communities live in harmony and contribute to a better world from their riches of wisdom and compassion*religious and cultural fears and hatreds are replaced with understanding and respect *people everywhere come to know and care for their neighbors *the richness of human and religious diversity is woven into the fabric of communal, civil, societal and global life *the world's most powerful and influential institutions move beyond narrow self-interest to realize common good *the earth and all life are cherished, protected, healed and restored *all people commit to living out their highest values and aspirations. Motivated by hospitality and compassion inherent in the world's religious and spiritual traditions, the council creates open forums through presentations and workshops in which individuals, communities and institutions of goodwill and hope come together. The organization hosts a religious parliament every four years.
