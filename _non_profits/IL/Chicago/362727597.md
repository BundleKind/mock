## Long description

The mission of cje seniorlife (cje) is to facilitate independence of older adults and to enhance quality of life by advocating on their behalf and by offering programs and services throughout the continuum of care for individuals, families and the community. Lieberman center for health and rehabilitation is a skilled nursing care residence (accepting medicaid, medicare and private pay) offering long-term care, alzheimer's special care unit, short-term rehabilitation, and hospice/end of life care. In the past year, lieberman provided person-focused skilled nursing care to more than 300 elderly residents (average age: 89) while also providing life enrichment opportunities. Most notable are its award-winning creative art therapies that focus on building personal connections and improving communication skills. Lieberman has extremely high staff to client ratios compared to other (nationally-ranked) nursing home facilities. Lieberman's haag pavilion for short-term rehabilitation annually serves 370 individuals recovering from an acute illness, injury or exacerbation of a disease. At an average stay of 3 weeks, haag pavilion exceeds the standard for returning patients (with increasing medical complexity due to their more advanced age) to their prior level of functioning before the illness or injury. Lieberman closely monitors its outcomes through a variety of measures to ensure that it meets or exceeds the regional and national averages of re-hospitalization rates, improved functional abilities, falls data, and house acquired pressure ulcers.
