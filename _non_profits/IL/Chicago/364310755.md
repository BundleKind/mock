## Long description

The foundation was established exclusively for the benefit of and to carry out the purposes of the jewish federation of metropolitan chicago, a not-for-profit organization. Distributions are made for the benefit of the jewish federation of metropolitan chicago's hillel program which supports a vast array of jewish activities for students at colleges, universities and professional schools in illinois. The hillel program provides opportunities for jewish students to explore and celebrate their jewish identity at 16 different college campuses in illinois, as well as through hillel regional programs. Hillel adds value - and jewish values - to the lives of jewish college students and the entire campus community. Hillel seeks to create a pluralistic, welcoming and inclusive environment for jewish college students: an environment where students are encouraged to grow intellectually, spiritually and socially.
