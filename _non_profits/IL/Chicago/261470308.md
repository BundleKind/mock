## Long description

Chicago workers' collaborative's mission is to promote full employment and equality for the lowest wage-earners, primarily temporary staffing workers, in the chicago region through leadership and skills training, critical assistance and services, advocacy and collaborative action. The organization has assisted thousands of economically disadvantaged immigrants, day laborers and others employed in the contingent underground workforce to move in on the mainstream. The organization also educates about workplace rights, provides critical services to its members, and mobilizes to gain full access to employment for all workers, especially immigrants and african americans.
