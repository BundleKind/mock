## Long description

Refugees thrive international funds holistic legal aid, educational, and health programs to ensure refugees have the protection and support they need to thrive. We focus on funding effective, local direct service organizations in the countries that neighbor crisis zones and host a disproportionate number of the world's refugees. Refugees thrive raised funds this year through directed e-mails to mailing list subscribers. We have not yet dispersed funds to any operating partners as the fundraising and partner funding proposal processes was not completed by the end of this tax year.
