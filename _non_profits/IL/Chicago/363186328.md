## Long description

The ounce of prevention fund gives children in poverty the best chance for success in school and in life by advocating for and providing the highest quality care and education from birth to age five. The ounce provides high-quality early childhood services for low-income children, birth to age five, and their families as well as services to pregnant women, through a multi-site network of early head start and head start directly-operated programs, and partner and delegate agencies, in high-needs communities throughout chicago and surrounding suburbs. In fiscal year 2015, the ounce directly operated two programs at the educare chicago school, and one program at the hayes center, and subcontracted with eight agencies at 14 geographically- and racially-diverse sites, serving more than 1,400 young children, pregnant women and their families.
