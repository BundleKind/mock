## Long description

Heartland housing is a community housing development organization which facilitates the development of people through the preservation and creation of affordable and supportive housing with the priority of meeting the needs of homeless persons and families, very low income individuals and persons with chronic disabilities. Heartland housing, inc. Was created as a non-profit 501(c)(3) affordable housing developer in 1989. Since that time, we have developed 1,846 affordable housing units in the city of chicago and parts of milwaukee. Heartland currently owns 1,334 units and manages 73% of its portfolio. The projects cater to various different types of participants such as low income, homeless, and seniors. In addition, some of the projects provide supportive services to the participants that help them transition to permanent housing as well as assist them in finding work. The long term goal of the company is to consistently meet the needs of its target population and facilitate the development of the participant's lives into society.
