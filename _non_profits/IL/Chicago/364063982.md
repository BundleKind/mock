They envision a nation where all workers enjoy the rights to: (continued on schedule o)* wages, health care, and pensions that allow workers to raise families and retire with dignity* safe working conditions* organize and bargain collectively to improve wages, benefits, and conditions without harassment, intimidation, or retaliation* equal protection under labor law - regardless of immigration status - and an end to the practice of pitting immigrant and u. S. -born workers against one another* fair and just participation in a global economy that promotes the welfare of both domestic and foreign workers
