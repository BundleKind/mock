## Long description

Touched by an animal preserves the nurturing bond between people and their companion animals by helping the elderly and others maintain this loving relationship and providing lifetime homes for cats when neeeded, in our home, where cats-are-purrsons-too. The organization provides a place where cats can be cared for and nurtured until lifetime homes can be found for the, or if needed, where they can spend the rest of their natural lives in good care.
