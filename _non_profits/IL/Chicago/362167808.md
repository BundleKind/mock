## Long description

Norc at the university of chicago conducts research and data science on critical societal issues to guide decision-making and the development of programs and public policy. Our experts identify relationships and trends, and evaluate programs and interventions, in the areas of economics, markets, and the workforce; education, training, and learning; global development; health and well-being; and society, media, and public affairs. In the course of this work, they advance research methods and technologies, and foster the responsible and scientifically rigorous use of data. The national opinion research center is an independent scientific research institution operating for the public benefit. Since 1941, norc has conducted groundbreaking studies, created and applied innovative methods and tools, and advanced principles of scientific integrity and collaboration. Today, government, corporate, and nonprofit clients around the world partner with norc to transform increasingly complex information into useful knowledge. Some representative clients include the bureau of justice statistics, the bureau of labor statistics, the census bureau, the centers for disease control and prevention, the centers for medicare & medicaid services, the department of agriculture, the department of education, the energy information administration, the federal reserve board, the health resources and services administration, the cms innovation center, the medicare payment advisory commission, the millennium challenge corporation, the national institute of standards and technology, the united states agency for international development, and tricare management activity. Norc also conducts research on behalf of numerous foundations such as the joyce foundation, the rockefeller foundation, the scan foundation, the sloan foundation, the henry j. Kaiser family foundation, and others. Norc conducts research in the following areas: economics, markets, and the workforce; education, training, and learning; global development; health and well-being; and society. Norc's expertise is evidenced in this selection of some of its landmark studies, such as the national surveys of youth, one of the most successful large-data resources in the social sciences; the national immunization survey, one of the largest telephone surveys in the united states; the survey of earned doctorates and survey of doctorate recipients; the survey of consumer finances, which provides detailed information on the finances of u. S. Families; the national survey of early care and education, which provides data on consumers and providers; work for the centers for medicare & medicaid services that provides detailed information on the implementation of the affordable care act; the national social life, health, and aging project that delivers critical information on the correlation between social factors and older people's health; and the general social survey, the most frequently analyzed source of social science data outside of the u. S. Census, which norc has conducted since 1972.
