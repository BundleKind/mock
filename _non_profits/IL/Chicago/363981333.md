## Long description

Fred woods home, was formed in 1994 for the development and operation of multi-family housing projects for low income families comprised of at least one adult infected with hiv/aids. These projects are operated under section 811 of the national housing act and (see scehd. O) regulated by the u. S. Department of housing and urban development (hud) with respect to rental charges and operating methods. Currently, there are two projects operated by the organization. Two independent living projects for homeless families living with hiv/aids in chicago, illinois. One project consists of nine units of permanent supportive housing for nine families. The second project consists of six units of permanent supportive housing for five families with one unit for a resident manager.
