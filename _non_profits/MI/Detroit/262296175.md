## Long description

Young nation promotes youth and community development through cultural and educational initiatives. Young nation acquired the property at 8869 avis st in detroit for near future development. The building purchase is the foundational piece of the larger project to develop a plaza for commercial and community use at the corner of elsmere and avis. The plaza will include commercial tenant community space indoors for programming, and an outdoor space for performance and gathering. Each year young nation and the alley project hosts an annual angels night event. The event takes place the night before halloween which has become a citywide rally of community involvement over the years. This follows years of detroits struggle with an epidemic of crime and arson on devils night the eve of halloween. Taps annual angels night celebrations merge themes of social justice civic engagement mentoring and honoring those who came before us and children and family. These themes acknowledge the season of celebration and collaboration in the neighborhood during a week that hosts angels night halloween all saints day and dia de los muertos.
