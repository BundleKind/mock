## Long description

To help detroit youths excel academically by developing focus, discipline, creative thinking, spatial reasoning, character and strategic planning through education, arts, language, fitness and leadership programs and through the game of chess. Scholastic competitive teams: approximately 150 students played on competitive chess teams sponsored by young detroit thinkers during the last year. Young detroit thinkers provided coaching, organization, transportation, and opportunities for children to compete both locally and nationally. In 2014-2015 the teams traveled to tournaments in canada, florida, ohio, georgia, illinois and tennessee as well as numerous state and local tournaments. During 2014-2015 we offered chess instruction in four detroit schools. The students were challenged daily to increase their knowledge, test their skills, and strengthen their character. Several players and teams won city, state, and national prizes.
