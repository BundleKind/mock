## Long description

The ymca foundation (the 'foundation') is a support organization which supports programs and services aligned with the charitable purposes of the ymca of metropolitan detroit ('ymca'), a section 501(c)(3) organization which qualifies as a publicly supported organization under sections 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(a)(vi) of the code, and other public charities that are closely related in purpose or function to the ymca. The foundation supports programs and activities designed to enhance character, education, community development, arts and culture, health, and social services for children, families and communities, principally those conducted by the ymca. Funds from the ymca foundation support a myriad of ymca branch priorities from camping scholarships at camp ohiyesa and nissokone, to day camp scholarships at 10 branches across southeast michigan to the minority achievers programming serving the inner city of detroit. Designated gifts to several ymca branches support specific programs such as ymca swim teams and literacy initiatives in accordance with the wishes of the original donors.
