## Long description

The mission of the boggs school is to nurture creative, critical thinkers who contribute to the well-being of their communities. The james and grace lee boggs school (also known as the boggs school) is a public school academy (charter school) serving students in grades k 6 on detroits east side. The school is chartered by eastern michigan university. The school implements place-based education, a model of instruction focused on place, where the geography, history, community members, problems, and resources of childrensconcentric communities form the foundation for academic and artistic learning. It is a community-based school, as the community has been part of the visioning and building of the school itself. Community teachers, non-certified teachers from the arts and local communities, teach boggs students their arts and skills in cooperation with the certified classroom teachers. The 2014-2015 school year was the school's second year in operation, serving 84 children and their families in 4 classrooms.
