## Long description

Idea envisions a world where the deaf in the philippines and elsewhere enjoy social and economic equality, exchanging isolation for community, servitude for self-reliance. Our mission is to foster self-reliance by providing academic, vocational physical, spiritual, and economic opportunities for deaf children, adults, and families. Education - through ideas student sponsorship program, 400 impoverished deaf children were funded to be able to attend special education classes in the philippines this past year. Idea also funded training-in-service as well as the purchase of school materials and equipment for classes. In addition, indigent deaf children were porvided food and lodging while attending school. Part of the funding was also allocated to provide vocational education and hands-on training for deaf high school students in the philippines.
