## Long description

Our mission is to promote health and fitness of women. The montana women's run is an event with over 8,000 participants who either run or walk 2 or 5 miles. The race is to promote women and children to get out and be active. Related events include getting started clinics to encourage participants to get in shape for the race, kids run to promote fun with physical activity and pasta night dinner with an inspirational speaker to motivate participants. The monies identified in grants are donations to local charitable institutions (ywca, ymca, billings clinic foundation, montana state university-billings, rocky mountain college) which promote women's health and fitness.
