## Long description

To develop children socially, emotionally, and cognitively, to encourage their curiosity, and to help them realize their full potential. We define quality as an environment that inspires children's natural curiosity and believe children learn best through doing. We partner with families to support them in their role as their child's first and most important teachers and believe that through this partnership we create a foundation for a child's future success. The center provides early childhood educational programs for preschool children, an afterschool program during the regular school year, and summer camp june through august for 102 children per day in daycare, and 18 children per day (june-august) in summer camp. The center also provides a pre-kindergarten program for preschool children, not funded by the state, serving four-year-old children during the regular school year, for 20 children per day (august through may).
