## Long description

The mission of the arthritis foundation is to improve lives through leadership in prevention, control and cure of arthritis and related diseases. Community help & support: the arthritis foundation community programs empower people in local communities nationwide. The foundation provides opportunities for people to connect with others with similar challenges and develop supportive relationships. The arthritis foundation programs include kids and family camps, the juvenile arthritis national conference, the walk with ease exercise program, and exercise and aquatics programs. The people we reach through these programs and arm with information and self-management strategies have a better perspective on their disease and, in turn, better outcomes.
