## Long description

The interdenominational theological center (itc) is a consortium of denominational seminaries whose mission is to educate christian leaders for ministry and service in the church and the global community. The itc educates and nurtures women and men who commit to and practice a liberating and transforming spirituality; academic discipline; religious, gender, and cultural diversity; and justice and peace. Instructional, public service and research - itc had 271 enrolled students and had 81 students graduate. The faculty is made up of 16 full time and 10 adjunct professors. The faculty and administration create a spiritual environment in which critical thinking, investigation, reflection, evaluation, communication, decision-making, and responsible action are fostered. They challenge all students to become involved in the problems which affect the human spirit; to become active on behalf of both the academic community and the community beyond the campus to develop an appreciation for the disciplines that contribute to theological resources in an ethically responsible fashion; and to maintain continuous development of the intellect, spirit, and skills required for spiritual growth.
