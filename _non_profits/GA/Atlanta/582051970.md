## Long description

To engage and enrich the lives of jewish undergraduate and graduate students so that they may enrich the jewish people and the world. Jewish living and learning - hillel fosters jewish student growth by developing a variety of jewish religious and spiritual communities, celebrating jewish holidays and shabbat in a pluralistic and open environment, and exploring our rich traditions and culture through creative activities and memorable experiences; we want our students to grow jewishly. By offering a variety of religious and spiritual opportunities, students will be able to develop an understanding of judaism's many forms (ex. Religious observance and practice). Students will also have the ability to link the meaning and relevance of jewish history and traditions to jewish life today. Programming in this area includes but is not limited to: text study, lunch and learn, and shabbat and holiday observance.
