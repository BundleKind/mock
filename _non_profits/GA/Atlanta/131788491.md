## Long description

To eliminate cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer, saving lives, and diminishing suffering from the disease through research, education, advocacy, and service. Research programs provide financial support to fund and conduct research into the causes of cancer; how it can be prevented, detected early, and treated successfully; how to improve the quality of life for people living with cancer; and to advocate for laws and policies that help further cancer research. Our research program expenses included both our extramural research grants and intramural program, which includes our comprehensive cancer prevention study ('cps-3'). Grants to affiliates: $3,408,964
