## Long description

Our mission is to transform the lives of homeless men and women through employment, training, and support services that will empower them to leave homelessness and achieve self-sufficiency while providing cleaning services to improve the community. Samaritan house clean street team offers homeless men and women transitional employment opportunities, training, and support services that will empower them to leave homelessness. The employment opportunities include street clean-up projects, along with interior and exterior janitorial services. The program engages 25 individuals each year, with an estimated fifty percent able to successfully transition to full-time employment.
