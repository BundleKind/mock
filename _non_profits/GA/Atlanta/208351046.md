## Long description

The organization exists to provide employment, rehabilitative services, job training, and job placement services for persons with disabilities or disadvantaging conditions. Store sales - goodwill of north georgia's mission is to put people to work. We achieve this by providing a vast array of job training and employment services to thousands of individuals each year. In fiscal year 2015, we served 2,536,845 donors at 59 collection sites and served 7,082,494 customers at 55 goodwill stores. The proceeds from our donated goods program help fund our mission-related programs, services, and seven career centers across north georgia. Our stores also serve as real-world on-the-job training sites for some of our program participants.
