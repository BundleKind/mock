## Long description

To provide outstanding education, focused on children's academic and social development in a caring community environment. Instruction - with teaching teams and fewer than 350 students from preschool through eighth grade, cliff valley is distinguished by our teachers' ability to bring the highest level of expertise, experience, and creativity to the classroom setting. Student-teacher ratios range from 4:1 in preschool to 8:1 in kindergarten through eighth grade, and students' experiences reflect this.
