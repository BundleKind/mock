## Long description

Emory ccf seeks to build a thriving community of sold-out believers who actively seek ways to change their world with love, both locally and internationally. We exist for college students at emory university who are not seeking formal church or campus ministry involvement. Emory christian campus fellowship (known on campus as bread) seeks to change the lives of emory students who claim no religious affiliation by changing them from one recipient of god's love to multipliers of god's love. We do this through hospitality (free coffeehouse), providing a sense of community (dinners, retreats, trips), small group bible studies and love in action (community service). During 2015, bread served over 150 students.
