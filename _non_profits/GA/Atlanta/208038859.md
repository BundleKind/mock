## Long description

First step's mission is to end homelessness by helping men, women and families develop a reliable source of income. We accomplish the mission with two programs. First step staffing provides jobs to individuals who can work. First step benefits fast-tracks individuals with severe disabilities for disability income and health insurance. First step staffing is designed to serve men and women who are ready and motivated to work. First step staffing contracts with employers and then directly employs men and women to fill those contract jobs. To help them successfully re-enter the job market, first step provides training, job coaching, transportation to work, and any necessary uniforms, tools, or equipment. First step has had a powerful impact on individuals' lives and in the community. Since it started in 2007, first step staffing has helped over 2,100 people re-enter the workforce. Cumulatively, they earned over $4,000,000 on first step's payroll and they paid over $700,000 in payroll taxes.
