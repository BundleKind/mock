## Long description

See schedule o
  
  in 2014, impact france facilitated grants in the amount of $719,897 to 15 different ministries. We once again mobilized almost 2,000 individuals and churches to pray for france during the annual pray for france campaign. Through our efforts, we supported initiatives ranging from outreach to the muslim community to internet discipleship, church planting coordination, and direct support to local churches as well as youth evangelism.
