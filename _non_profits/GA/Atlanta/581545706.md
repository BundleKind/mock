## Long description

To support georgia families and individuals from birth to 26 impacted by disabilities or special health care needs
  
  parent training and information center (pti): this program offers help to families with early intervention, education, and transition systems and services. This program is designed to enable families to receive training and information on their rights, responsibilities, and protections under individuals with disabilities education act (idea), so they can actively participate in planning and decision making that affects their children and their children's future. It is desired that children with disabiities & their families are given the tools needed to meet developmental goals and be prepared to lead productive, independent adult lives, to the maximum extent possible. Families can use regional coordinators, the parent to parent website available in several languages, and volunteer parent to parent trainers. In 2014-2015, there were over 5,264 assistance calls including over 3,494 calls related to education assistance; 658 families received intensive specialized assistance in school issues; over 85 new volunteers trained as parent to parent supporting parents.
