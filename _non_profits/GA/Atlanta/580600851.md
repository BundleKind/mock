## Long description

To be a powerful voice for all children, a relevant resouce for families and communities and be a strong advocate for education and the well-being of every child. Scholarships, grants and awards assist local units by providing training and resources to promote the health, safety, education and overall welfare of children and youth. Conventions, conferences and events are designed to educate, and provide relevant programs, strategies, resources and support to pta leaders and members so that they are empowered to effectively connect to families and the local school communities in successful achievement of all students and improvement of all schools. Empowering families to assist in the educational journey of their children and youth is vital and key to ensure students transition birth to pre-kindergarten, kindergarten to grade 12, to high school graduation, and to college and career readiness.
