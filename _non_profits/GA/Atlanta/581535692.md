## Long description

Lutheran services of georgia provides program services that enhance the stability, health, wellness, and safety of individuals and families in georgia. We offer a comprehensive platform of social service programs, including refugee resettlement, employment and social adjustment; immigration; adoption; specialized foster care; family intervention services; and services for youth and adults with developmental disabilities. Lutheran services of georgia 'faces' program (facilitating advocacy, care, education, and shelter) helps youth and adults with developmental disabilities find host homes and environments in which they can thrive and obtain the support they need to live successfully in the community. Referrals for the program come from support coordination agencies, regional office staff, and family members. Faces ensures that supportive services and assistance in understanding and using medicaid waivers are available for participants, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities. During the fiscal year, 119 participants with developmental disabilities were placed in 98 host homes, served by 179 support companions.
