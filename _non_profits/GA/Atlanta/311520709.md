## Long description

To improve the overall health and well-being of young people in georgia to ensure a more powerful future for us all. Gcapp's second chance homes program provides safe, family-like living situations for young mothers, age 13-23, and their children, as well as some pregnant teens. In partnership with the georgia department of human services, gcapp operates a network of 5 second chance homes. The second chance home model is designed to address the myriad of issues related to teen pregnancy and literally give teen mothers, who are at greatest risk, a second chance at success. The second chance homes network helps teen mothers become self sufficient by providing them a safe and stable living environment, educational support to complete high school, parenting skills, and life skills. The ultimate goal is the avoidance of a repeat teen pregnancy and put the young mothers on a firm path of long-term economic independence. Since the first second chance home opened in 2001, the program has served over 1300 young mothers and their children.
