## Long description

Charitable purpose
  
  the hope and light foundation supported families living with spinal muscular atrophy by holding our second annual adapted toy program. Adapted toys and switches to operate them were mailed to each child. This technology assisted children by allowing them to play independently. The foundation also partnered with lekotek of georgia to distribute adapted toys to children living in the metro atlanta area.
