## Long description

The museum is dedicated to collecting, preserving, interpreting & teaching about the holocaust & the experience of jews in georgia. The museum houses a permanent holocaust gallery, special exhibit galleries, a resource library & an extensive archival collection. Education & programs - the museum continued with its annual programs: bearing witness (survivors of the holocaust) speakers; yom hashoah remembrance ceremony; summer institute: teaching the holocaust to educators and life long learners. Our survivor legacy film project continues to capture stories of the holocaust told by the survivors. Our educators are continuing to refine and expand the we are here program which teaches the holocaust to jewish families. The molly blank jewish concert series enjoyed its second year, presenting 2 concerts featuring the atlanta opera and a third concert featuring renowned israeli performer, ester rada. We also hosted the first in a series of 4 girls lead theatrical workshops designed to enhance girls leadership skills.
