## Long description

Dance canvas' mission is to provide opportunities and venues to increase the awareness of professional dance in the southeast. We achieve our mission through three program areas of service career development, youth outreach and audience engagement. Professional performance series (choreographer career development initiative): provides 10 professional choreographers with career building resources and a venue for rehearsals/performances; works with 50 professional dancers to create world premier dance works to present to over 1200 audience members (including at least 600 youth through our outreach efforts). We provide career mentoring services to the choreographers. We provide critical analysis projects to our youth audiences.
