## Long description

The mission of the children's school is to enrich minds and inspire dreams. The children's school is a progressive elementary school serving students from age 3 through sixth grade in a diverse community in midtown atlanta. Grounded in principles of excellence, innovation and play, the children's school graduates passion-driven young adults who lead lives of purpose in an interconnected world. Elementary school education services provided to 381 students from age 3 - grade 6 for 175 instructional days. The children's school's curriculum strives to instill in each child the confidence to take responsibility for their education at an early age. We incorporate a hands-on approach to learning, encouraging creativity and self-reliance. Scholastic records prove students realize not only academic potential but also strengthened self-image, emotional skills and lifelong learning skills.
