## Long description

Making the grade supports high school and college education along with necessary living expenses for ethiopian students studying both in ethiopia and in the us. We support approximately 50 ethiopian students attending private high schools and college in ethiopia. All of these children live in one of five houses in five cities that we support providing housing, food, medical care, transportation, and an adult house manager in each house.
