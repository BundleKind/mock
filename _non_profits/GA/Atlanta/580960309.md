## Long description

To support senior independence through meals, shelter, education, and community. Meal services provides more than 160,000 nutritious meals to approximately 689 atlanta seniors annually. These seniors are unable to prepare or afford the nutrition they need due to extenuating circumstances such as disability or poverty. We offer eight different meal types to meet specialized health requirements. Urgent meals and pantry items are provided for seniors in desperate need of assistance. Meals are delivered by staff and volunteers which decreases isolation for many of our senior clients.
