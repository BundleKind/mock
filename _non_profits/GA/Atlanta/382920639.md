## Long description

Euf's principal mission is to provide financial assistance and other support for the education of students attending earth university(escuela de agricultura de la regin tropical hmeda) and for earth's programs and initiatives in support of that education. Earth university is a non-profit four-year degree-granting institution with international administration, faculty, students, programs and initiatives. Earth and its students contribute to the sustainable development of the humid tropics through education in the agricultural sciences and natural resources, and the development of students as 'catalysts for change,' individuals with strong ethical and human values, social and environmental consciousness and an entrepreneurial mentality. Euf also fully embraces earth university's mission to 'prepare leaders with ethical values to contribute to the sustainable development of the humid tropics and construct a prosperous and just society. '
