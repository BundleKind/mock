## Long description

To provide training in the area of construction to allow the opportunity for low income residents and a chance to lift individuals permanently out of poverty. Trade-up, through it's pre apprenticeship program, will provide a catalyst for individuals to move into an established field - construction. Trade-up will help its participants acquire general skills in, and attain basic knowledge of, tools, equipment and materials; site/project preparation, maintenance; and safety. These skills, once developed and applied in the local workforce, are likely to be sustainable and afford continuing employment opportunity for low income residents and a chance to lift individuals permanently out of poverty. Trade-up seeks to address some of the poverty and unemployment issues by providing meaningful training opportunities to residents of highly impoverished communities and to create a new pipeline of trained construction workers.
