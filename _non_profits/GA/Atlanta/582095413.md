## Long description

The organization's primary exempt purpose is to advocate and secure the protection and stewardship of the chattahoochee river, its tributaries and watershed, in order to restore and preserve their ecological health for the people, fish and wildlife that depend on the river system
  
  in 2014, the largest program area was crks community outreach and stewardship projects, which reached more people than ever before adding 1,695 new members to the organization. Crk held 45 water conservation workshops, distributed 460 rain barrels and reached more than 1,500 people with the tools and knowledge to adopt water conservation and efficiency practices at home and in their businesses. Crk hosted multiple river awareness events including the river race and festival, 20th anniversary gala, member celebration, outings and other events where over 4,691 people attended. We engaged 1,411 volunteers from community organizations and corporations in stream, lake and river cleanups, including 550 people in the 4th annual sweep the hooch multi-site cleanup for a total of 20 tons of trash removed from waterways and 1. 8 tons of trash recycled.
