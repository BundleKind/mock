## Long description

Skyland trail inspires people with mental illness to thrive through a holistic program of evidence-based psychiatric treatment, integrated medical care, research, and education. Residential treatment: residential treatment services offer graduated levels of care that are appropriate for individuals leaving an acute care facility who are not ready for community reintegration. Residential communities are licensed by the state of georgia, accredited by the joint commission, and are unlocked voluntary facilities. Licensed nursing staff is onsite 24/7. Skyland trail south residential campus offers the most intensive level of support, while skyland trail north offers more opportunities to practice independent living skills. Residential clients living at south and north come to the main campus each weekday for evidence-based psychiatric services and individual and group therapy sessions. During 2014, admissions grew seven percent over 2013 with a 38 percent growth in clients from outside the southeast region. 31 percent of clients received a financial aid award during 2014.
