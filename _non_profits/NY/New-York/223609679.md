## Long description

We connect with communities in some of the poorest and most remote areas of the world, taking into account the lack of access to proper healthcare and educational opportunities as well as weak or nonexistent economic dev
  
  when citta registered the michael a. Daube charitable trust in odisha, india in 1997, there were no roads or electricity in the villages. The first order of business was to build a much-needed hospital in juanga village, and this was completed on april 2, 1997. The hospital has been growing in capacity ever since at the start of the project there were over 1,000 patients each month. There had been no previous medical care in the village, and the health issues the locals faced were neglected. As of 2012, we provide care for 25-30 patients daily and treat up to 8,000 patients annually. The education and services we provide have helped reduce the number of those in need of emergency care. We have 22 staff members including three general medicine physicians and three visiting surgeons performing gynecology, dentistry and general surgery. During the monsoon months june-september, extreme heat, rain and lack of sanitation bring many cases of dysentery and fever to the hospital.
