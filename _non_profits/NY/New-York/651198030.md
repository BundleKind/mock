## Long description

La fuente empowers immigrants, workers, and their communities to take action through civic participation, grassroots organizing, and leadership development. We work in collaboration with labor unions, faith institutions, and community organizations to build a movement for a just society. Victories: *adoption of the muslim school holiday in nyc public schools. *successfully advocated for the times square characters and worked with nypd to provide a safe work space for both characters and pedestrians. Civic participation: most recently, we registered 5,000 new citizens and promoted to vote in the next upcoming local and state elections.
