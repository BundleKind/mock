## Long description

The organization's mission is to reduce poverty by providing assistance directly to the extreme poor and allowing them -- not the donor -- to choose where they invest. Givedirectly offers a service allowing others - governments, foundations, individual donors - to provide direct cash transfers to the poor. The organization's proprietary model re-engineers fieldwork for the digital era, allowing it to complete these transfers securely, efficiently and transparently. Using the latest technololgy at every step, givedirectly locates recipients, integrates them into electronic payments networks, and monitors transfers end-to-end. The organization charges donors the full cost of delivering this service and nothing more. Since 2009, give directly has reached approximately 19,000 extremely poor households in kenya and uganda. We enrolled a total of 10,631 households through the end of 2015.
