To promote israeli culture, tradition, language and values in the new york metro area through social, educational and cultural projects and events, and by establishing, maintaining and working with a forum of community leaders of the israeli community in the new york metro area, in order to recognize, analyze and address needs of members of the community, increase cooperation between community leaders and existing organizations and, in furtherance of its purposes, cooperate and create ventures with other charitable organizations. Website and social media communication channel development: during the summer of 2013 moatza developed the www. Moatza. Org website. People could learn more about the organization, its purpose, contact us with their needs and wants, donate to the non-profit organization, and easily be added on to the email list. The website, along with the moatzany facebook and twitter pages allow for thousands of israelis living in the new york area to stay connected, interact with one another, learn about moatza's programs and activities, and feel a sense of belonging to a (familiar) community.
