## Long description

The organizations goal is to help deepen the understanding, both in the united states and abroad, of economic, social, environmental, legal and foreign policy choices of different states and international organizations. The organization plans to provide financial support, through donations, contributions, and other similar distributions, to organizations dedicated to strengthening peaceful cooperation between states, advocating a safe and open international system, and promoting sustainable development. During its second year, the organization continued to provide support granted to the center for international relations and sustainable development (cirsd) in belgrade, serbia. The grant was intended to assist cirsd in fulfilling its goals of strengthening peaceful cooperation; advocating for a more open, inclusive, prosperous, and safe international system; and promoting the worldwide implementation of the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Additionally, the friends of cirsd hosted several events in new york, including a keynote fireside chat between vuk jeremic, president of the 67th un general assembly, and gen. David petraeus, chairman of the kkr global institute and a former cia director.
