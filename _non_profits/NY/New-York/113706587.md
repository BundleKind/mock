## Long description

Jcps mission is to build a new model of jewish belonging. Jcp cultivates a community in which members develop a strong sense of personal ownership and connection to jewish identity. We engage families of diverse jewish and interfaith backgrounds with meaningful educational, spiritual and cultural programs that invite people to explore their jewish heritage and sense of jewish community. 1) the center for jewish life expanded further with new shabbat and holiday programs added to the calendar, including friday evening services. The center for jewish life also launched a new youth program for children in kindergarten through 5th grade. 2) jcp continued to work on the effort to expand its physical program space, and plan for the future growth of the organization, and began working with a capital campaign consultant in the spring of 2015. 3) jcp developed a new bar and bat mitzvah experience program which began to serve a cohort of children preparing for their ceremony as they also participate in the jcp hebrew school project's middle school grades.
