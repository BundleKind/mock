## Long description

Build the organizational capacity of local lgbt aapi groups, develop leadership, promote visibility, educate the community, enhance grassroots organizing, and expand collaborations and challenge homophobia and racism
  
  nqapia hosted five (5) regional leadership summits to train 217 lgbt aapis. A series of intensive workshops helped attendees to network and build local capacity, invigorate organizing, and develop leadership. During june pride month, nqapia persuaded ksci-tv in los angeles la18 and ktsf in the bay area aired multilingual public service announcements of aapi parents who love their lgbt kids. The videos were produced with the help of the asian pride project. Nqapia also worked with 12 non-lgbt asian american, south asian, southeast asian, and pacific islander organizations to issue powerful statements of lgbt solidarity to their membeships reaching 33,000 people. Immigrants' rights are vitally important to aapis and in august, nqpia delivered 2,776 postcards to the white house urging president obama to take executive action on immigrants' rights. Which he did on november 20.
