## Long description

The conference board creates and disseminates knowledge about management and the marketplace to help businesses strengthen their performance and better serve society. Working as a global independent membership organization in the public interest, we conduct research, convene conferences, make forecasts, assess trends, publish information and analysis and bring executives together to learn from one another. The conference board conducts conferences, seminars, briefings and peer group councils to exchange insights among executives of corporations in various industry segments. During the six months ending december 31, 2014, the conference board held 8 conferences and 11 seminars.
