## Long description

The mission of boys & girls harbor is to empower children and their families to become full productive participants in society through education, cultural enrichment and social services. The harbor is an education focused organization committed to providing an individualized learning plan for every harbor student to assure rigorous, comprehensive academic training and emotional development, enriched by infusing the arts into its culture and curriculum during a student's formative years. The preschool's goal is to prepare students for kindergarten, enabling them to acquire the habits, knowledge, and skills necessary to be successful. Teachers are certified and instruct using research-based curricula aligned with common core standards and nyc acs' early learn standards. Learning is enriched by: computer technology, music and movement, educational trips and outdoor play. The preschool is funded by nyc acs, nyc doe, and private funders, and is assisted by an active parent advisory council. In spring 2015, all exiting 5 year olds enrolled for 2 years were assessed as kindergarten-ready through the bracken school readiness tests' composite score.
