## Long description

The mission of surprise lake camp is to provide a high quality jewish experience for children and young adults that is safe, fun and promotes personal growth. Through our summer camp and year round programs, we promote jewish identity building, environmental stewardship, and the development of values and skills that help people lead fulfilling lives and become assets to their communities. Surprise lake camp is committed to providing scholarships for families that cannot afford our full fee. Since 1902, surprise lake camp (slc) has provided a haven for children in the beautiful mountains of cold spring, ny. What makes slc the best is the beauty of the site, the richness of the people and the program, the sense of history and tradition, and the magic we create when the whole thing comes together. We are particularly proud of our open, inclusive community that is sensitive to the needs of interfaith and diverse families. In 2014, there were over 700 individual campers served and slc awarded over $970,000 in scholarships. In addition, there were over 20 bar/bat mitzvahs during camp.
