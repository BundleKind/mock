## Long description

King's academy, inc. Provides support through grants to king's academy psc (the 'academy'), a college preparatory school. In a setting rich in history and tradition, the academy is committed to providing a comprehensive college-preparatory education through a challenging curriculum in the arts and sciences; an integrated co-curricular program of athletics, activities, and community service; and a nurturing residential environment. Our students will learn to be independent, creative, and responsible thinkers within an ethical community that encourages young men and women with diverse backgrounds and beliefs to excel, to respect one another, and to prepare for leadership. King's academy's primary achievements include supporting the school with funding for student scholarships, student activities, visiting faculty support, campus construction and renovations.
