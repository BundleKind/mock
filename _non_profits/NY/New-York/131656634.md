## Long description

Since 1914, the american jewish joint distribution committee (jdc) has acted on behalf of north america's jewish communities and others to fulfill the principle that 'kol yisrael arevim zeh l'zeh' - all jews are responsible for one another. Relief, welfare and health: relief and welfare programs provide human services to jews in need in countries around the world. Services are provided to those individuals that meet criteria relevant to the local environment, such as poverty and income levels, the existence or lack of available social services within a country, and consideration for physical mobility, disabilities, and unique circumstances.
