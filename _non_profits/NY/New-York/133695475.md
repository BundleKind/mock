## Long description

The tanenbaum center for interreligious understanding promotes mutual respect with practical programs that bridge religious difference and combat prejudice, hatred, and violence in areas of armed conflict, schools, workplaces, and health care settings. Tanenbaum is a not-for-profit, secular, non-sectarian organization that operates in the united states and abroad. For over two decades, tanenbaum has trained educators to teach about religious differences and combat bullying, helped medical professionals develop skills to care for religiously diverse patients and prevent disparities in care, created inclusive work environments in some of the worlds largest companies to counter religious harassment, and supported a network of courageous peacemakers in the worlds most contentious conflict zones. The workplace program for business leaders, global employers, managers and human resources professionals counters harassment and includes training and materials on how to effectively work with an increasingly religiously diverse workforce, thereby creating a more productive and inclusive environment for all employees.
