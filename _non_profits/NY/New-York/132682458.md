  poets & writers magazine, published six times a year, delivers to its readers profiles of noted authors and publishing professionals, practical how-to articles, and the most comprehensive list of grants and awards available in print. Columns such as agents & editors and the savvy self publisher offer insight into the business of publishing, while regular features such as why we write and the aha! moment consider aspects of craft. Special issues cover topics such as literary agents, independent publishing, and writing contests. New editorial projects include ampersand, a podcast offering listeners an overview of each issue of the magazine and a glimpse into the editorial process; and poets & writers live, a series of live events thematically linked to the magazine, presented in various cities around the u.
