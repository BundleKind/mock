## Long description

To build a bridge between the research and practice of geriatrics and the general public and to advocate on behalf of older adults and their special needs through public education and awareness programs. The health in aging foundation seeks support research initiatives that further the mission of the foundation by reducing disability and frailty and improve the quality of life and health outcomes for all older adults. The t. Franklin williams/gemmstar research scholar award is given to an academic geriatrician who is conducting research on older patients that has applicability to the care provided by sub-specialists of internal medicine. The hartford geriatrics health outcomes research scholar awards program supports physician-scientists committed to improving the health care of older adults during the critical transition from junior faculty to independent researcher.
