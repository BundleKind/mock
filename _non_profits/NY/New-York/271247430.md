## Long description

The organization's mission is
  
  the organization was founded to promote cultural advancement to vulnerable communities in developing countries around the world, for example, by facilitating the provision of education services in rural africa. Most schools built by the government in such regions lack basic supplies and skilled teachers. Impact network has piloted the first eschools in rural zambia. This holistic solution delivers not just access, but quality education. It empowers local teachers with a laptop and projector loaded with activity-based lesson plans for each day. To date, impact network has 10 schools in rural zambia which educates over 2,000 students.
