## Long description

The group foundation for advancing mental health is a philanthropic organization dedicated to changing lives through therapeutic group work by advancing the most effective and innovative approaches to group therapy education, training, research and community outreach. The group foundation advocates for and supports the research, education/training and community programs to assure the advancement of the most innovative group work to enhance people's lives. Evidence is now clear that group interventions are at the forefront of treaments to heal trauma, improve individual, family, and workplace relationships, treat psychological conditions and aid the military and their families in dealing with the psychological impact of war. In short, group changes lives. With the knowledge that groups change lives and promote mental health, the group foundation is dedicated to supporting the advancement of evidenced based group interventions and research, supporting the education and training of effective group leaders, and supporting community outreach and the dissemination of information for the benefit of the public and professional communities. Over the years, the gifts from our generous donors have allowed the group foundation to establish programs to advance education and training in group psychotherapy, establish the international board for certification of group psychotherapists, award innovative research and community outreach projects, fund training manuals for group work and provide agpa annual meeting scholarships and overall support for the meeting, through underwriting grants and the endowment of events.
