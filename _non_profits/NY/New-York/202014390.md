## Long description

Providing funds for individuals who have shown the potential to become successful members of society, but lack the resources to overcome poverty or abuse. To make a profound difference in the lives of highly motivated and qualified people who possess the desire and drive to succeed but lack the opportunity and resources. The organization seeks to accomplish this goal by awarding grants to help working women and children affected by domestic violence to create strong, and economically independent families in affordable housing. Grants are also awarded for other services such as, child care, job training and career, financial and psychological counseling. In addition, there is an educational mentoring program which awards grants and provides mentors to students from the foster care system who are attending post-secondary education.
