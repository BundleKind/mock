description: "The foundation contracted with the restigouche riparian association to fund expenses for necessary wardens, in close cooperation with and under the supervision of the department of natural resources of the province of new brunswick, canada. These personnel, designated assistants & game wardens offered protection to the atlantic salmon during its period in the river system. These activities involved controling poaches, watching for evidence of pollution, monitoring numbers of the fish in the estuary, the river and the spawning pools. "
