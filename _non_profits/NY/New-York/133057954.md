## Long description

Protection of wildlife & habitats
  
  conservation during this year conservation efforts included two major programs:(1) project safe flight making nyc safer for migratory birds. In addition to our regular monitoring for window strike victims in manhattan, we conducted a multi-variate light/glass study and worked with partners to devise a way to rate bird-friendly glass for leed. (2) our waterbird program focused on the health of the ny harbor using waterbirds as as bioindicators of estuary health. This program includes harbor herons and beach nesting shore birds nest and foraging surveys. In jamaica bay we conducted beach clean-ups and monitored horseshoe crabs and migratory shorebirds. And led educational outreach to local schools.
