## Long description

Creative art works' mission is to improve the lives of new york city youth ages 4-24 through in-school and out-of-school-time classes, community art-making events, and youth employment creating large-scale public and multi-media art. Creative art works (caw) expanded its iconic public art youth employment programs into the academic year with three after-school employment programs, engaging a total of 67% more participants in 2014 over 2013. The growth of this youth employment program grew out of its long-term successful summer programming. In caws most robust year ever, young adults 14-24 old were given full-time summer jobs and part-time after-school jobs; they created large-scale public art and multimedia projects around manhattan. Starting with concept development through to public unveiling, they gained tangible employment skills as well as general life skills such as leadership, teamwork, responsibility, and the power of taking initiative creating five murals and a related documentary video published a weblog and envisioned and completed dynamic culminating event brochures.
