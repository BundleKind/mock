## Long description

Csnyc's mission is to ensure that all of new york citys 1. 1 million public school students have access to a high-quality computer science education that puts them on pathway to college and career success. Csnyc just announced a 10 year, $80 million plan to bring computer science education to 100% of local public schools. The initiative, called computer science for all (cs4all), is a public-private partnership between csnyc and the city of new york and the nyc department of education. By 2025, all new york city public school students will receive at least one meaningful, high-quality computer science learning experience at each school level: elementary, middle, and high school. The centerpiece of the initiative is the training of 4,775 teachers who will, by year 10, bring computer science to more than 245,000 students each year. In addition to our work with the city, we supported 7 organizations through our computer science seed fund including the academy for software engineering and the bronx academy for software engineering, bootstrap, code. Org, scalable game design, scripted, the nyc department of educations software engineering program, and microsoft teals.
