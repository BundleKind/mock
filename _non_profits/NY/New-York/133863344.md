## Long description

The center's mission is three-fold: to protect and preserve the history of the jewish people; to democratize access to information and foster research; and to educate diverse constituencies through public programs and exhibitions. The center opened its doors in late 2000 as the new central address of five organizations dedicated to preserving jewish history: american jewish historical society, american sephardi federation, leo baeck institute, yeshiva university museum and yivo institute for jewish research. The five partners hold collections that total more than 500,000 volumes and 100 million archival documents, including tens of thousands of textiles, ritual objects, recordings, films and photographs, and works of art. Building operations: as the home to five partner organizations with over half a million books and five miles of archives, the center maintains hvac tuned for preservation of collection materials, maintenance and cleaning of office spaces, upkeep of building envelope, shared online public access catalog, shared database for digital objects, elevators, reading room management software and it services - all to the benefit of all partners, visitors to the facility and our many online researchers.
