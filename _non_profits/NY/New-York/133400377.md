## Long description

The institute for american values is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization whose mission is to study and strengthen key american values. The institute brings together leading scholars from across the human sciences and across the political spectrum for interdisciplinary deliberation, collaborative research and joint public statements. Family & civic values - research and publications on major issues of family well-being, family policy and civil society. The institute's immediate purpose is to examine the status and future of the family as a social institution. Its larger mission is to examine the social sources of competence, character and citizenship in the united states. Accordingly, institute activities are more than debates about policy. They are also conversations about culture and explorations of the american idea. By providing forums for scholarly inquiry and debate, the institute seeks to bring fresh knowledge to bear on the challenges facing the american family and civil society.
