## Long description

Ithaka harbors, inc. Is a not-for-profit organization that helps the academic community use digital technologies to preserve the scholarly record and to advance research and teaching in sustainable ways. We pursue this mission by providing innovative services that aid in the adoption of these technologies and that create lasting impact. We conduct rigorous research and think creatively with others about the impact and opportunities that advances in digital technology bring to the academic community; we share what we learn as broadly as possible; and, when needed, we build scalable enduring solutions. Ithaka currently pursues its mission through three innovative program services: jstor, portico, and ithaka s+r. Jstor is a not-for-profit digital library that provides access to more than 2,300 scholarly journals, 30,000 books, and millions of primary source objects and documents to people around the world. Jstor helps scholars, researchers, and students discover, use, and build upon this wide range of content through a dynamic online teaching, learning and research platform, while serving as a digital archive for publishers and libraries to ensure the content is preserved for future generations. In addition to the program service revenue of $68,703,571 reported above, ithaka received grant revenue of $582,546 allocable to jstor reported on part viii, line 1f.
