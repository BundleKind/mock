## Long description

The mission of the center for talent innovation is to drive ground-breaking research that leverages talent across the divides of gender, generation, geography, and culture; and to create a community united by an understanding that full utilization of the global talent pool is at the heart of competitive success. The center's flagship project is the task force for talent innovation (formerly called 'hidden brain drain task force')whose mission is to respond to the challenges posed by the research and create action and impact. To date, the task force has spearheaded 200-plus new best practices, many of which are 'second-generational' and go beyond access and opportunity to retention and acceleration. This action on the ground has garnered significant attention (articles in the harvard business review, wall street journal, financial times, huffington post, among others)which allows task force members to be branded as 'thought leaders' in global talent management. The task force is comprised of more than 85 global corporations and organizations representing nearly 6 million employees in 200 countries.
