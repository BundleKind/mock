## Long description

Our mission is to promote and protect affordable homeownership in new york so that middle- and working-class families are able to build strong, thriving communities. Network programs: as part of its coordinated foreclosure response, the center for new york city neighborhoods contracts with several legal service organizations and housing counseling providers. The center's legal service partners provide homeowners in foreclosure with advice and counsel, direct representation in court, and pro-se assistance. The center's housing counseling partners provide homeowners with one-on-one counseling services to save their homes or negotiate a sustainable housing solution dedicated counselors and support staff work closely with the homeowner to develop a budget, assess mortgage documentation, negotiate with lenders and servicers and assist the homeowners with other non-mortgage needs. The center also provides technical assistance to its network of providers with training and expertise on housing counseling, legal services, and consumer education and protection in new york city. As part of its consumer education, the center has undertaken a loan-scam prevention education and outreach campaign with the assistance of the new york state office of the attorney general (oag).
