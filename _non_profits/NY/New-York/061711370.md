## Long description

Getting out and staying out is dedicated to drastically reducing the recidivism rate for 16-24 year old men through purposeful education and directed employment. - continued to maintain a 10% recidivism rate for our guys vs a national average of over 50%. - 75% of goso participants who complete our curriculum are engaged in school or work or both at the same time. - in spite of rikers island's population becoming smaller, the number of participants in our east harlem office still continues to grow. - as we have seen a switch of where our guys primarily come from (from jails and prisons to the new york city courts) advocates, legal council, and others who have discovered goso, are recommending young men to our program at rates never before achieved. We had close to 600 young men walk through our doors in december 2014, a new record of participants.
