## Long description

Gpn's mission is to exponentially increase the impact of top-performing social programs that improve the lives of families and children. To this end, in 2012, gpn launched its signature initiative, the social impact exchange ('the exchange'). The exchange is a national membership association dedicated to scaling effective social solutions. It is made up of a community of funders, advisors, wealth managers, intermediaries, nonprofits and researchers interested in funding and developing practices for scaling-up social solutions. The exchange's purpose is to establish a marketplace ecosystem that consistently enables effective social interventions to achieve scaled impact. In 2014, gpn continued to develop the social impact exchange ('the exchange'), a cross-sector membership forum for sharing knowledge and increasing investment in scaling effective social programs and solutions. The exchange serves as both an online and in-person gathering place for those who are interested in learning about, implementing and funding large-scale expansions of high-impact nonprofit initiatives, including programs, products, services, organizations, social movements and more. Specific initiatives within the exchange include an annual conference on scaling, a business plan competition, working groups and a web platform that houses a contribution center (the 'social impact 100'/'s&i 100')and knowledge center.
