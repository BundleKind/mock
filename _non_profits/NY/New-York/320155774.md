## Long description

Our mission is two fold: to provide veterinary care and rehabilitation to native
  
  the wild bird fund center opened june 2012 in a beautiful landmark storefront at 565 columbus avenue. That first year we treated 1,500 patients. In 2015, the patient load grew to over 3,500. As word of our work spreads, more and more caring new yorkers come to us bird in hand. To meet the growing demand we leased the adjoining storefront to create a wildlife er, which will have an operating room with recovery cages, an x-ray facility and intensive care units for large animals. 150 volunteers work at the center. And four avian and exotic veterinarians consult.
