## Long description

The authors guild foundation educates authors about their rights and promotes the importance of writing, publishing, free speech, and copyright. The foundation provided the following program services: (1) fought to improve the condition and welfare of american authors by providing them with educational resources on the business of writing through free seminars and panel discussions and information resources provided on its website; (2) distributed 97 loans to writers in financial need, which do not have to be repaid; (3) litigated a major copyright case on behalf of all authors; and (4) engaged in advocacy efforts within the publishing industry on behalf of all authors.
