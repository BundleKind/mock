## Long description

The new york city urban debate league is the city's scholastic debate league. We provide debate education programs to all. Debate since athens, greece is the most rigorous academic program to prepare students and adults for success in college, career, citizenship, and community leadership. We provide every resource so schools and any community organization can start and sustain successful debate programs including practices everyday, workshops every week, tournaments every weekend, and debate camps all summer. Debaters have higher academic performance, attendance, graduation rates, and career and leadership success. The majority of supreme court justices, senators and many us presidents were former debaters. Debate closes the academic and civics achievement gap. We have been honored as 'one of the top humanities based programs in the country' by the national council for the humanities, institute for museum and library services, and president's committee for the arts and humanities. Debate tournaments - we hosted scholastic debate tournaments every month serving over 300 students (middle school and high school), teachers, parents and volunteers. We provide breakfast, lunch, workshops, judge training, 3-4 rounds of debate competitions, and an awards ceremony.
