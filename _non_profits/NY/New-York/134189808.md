## Long description

To reach out and expose diverse groups, especially young audiences, to all forms of performing, visual, media, and literary arts. Our afterschool programming served 2,000 students at 17 schools through a wide variety of arts education classes, including: musical mania!, a musical theatre class; dance around the world, a dance training class in styles such as afro-caribbean, indian and hip hop; flicker filmmaking, which enables young people to write and edit a short video; and art attack, where students draw, paint, and sculpt. We specialize in long-term commitments to schools. Club wingspan is our longest running program, founded in 2001 in response to the lack of arts education in public schools. Through the afterschool program, students gain weekly exposure to the arts, exploring their creative potential and building self-confidence that will shape their lives forever.
