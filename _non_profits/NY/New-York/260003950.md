## Long description

Living cities harnesses the collective power of philanthropy and financial institutions to improve the lives of low-income people and the cities where they live. The integration initiative - living cities' integration initiative demonstrates a new approach to both philanthropy and systemic change. It provides financial packages that include grants, loans and program-related investments (pris) to targeted areas, where the public, private, philanthropic and non-profit sectors have agreed to work as partners to address a variety of issues, including access to education, housing, health care, transit, and jobs for their low-income residents.
