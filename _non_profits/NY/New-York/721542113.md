## Long description

To reduce violence in the lives of youth and in our communities by building a team of youth who communicate a message of non-violence. Love is a not-for-profit, grassroots, youth-led organization. We educate and empower youth, ages 13 to 19, who have been witnesses,victims, or perpetrators of violence -in all of its forms- to stop this destructive cycle in their lives and in the lives of others. Media arts program (map)and leadership program : provide a supportive environment in which to examine the violence youth have experienced. The programs includes photography, journalism, videography and broadcasting and serves as a vehicle of expression, communications and education.
