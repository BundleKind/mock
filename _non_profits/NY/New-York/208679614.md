## Long description

Our mission is to empower youth and communities around the world to energize each other through education, international service learning, social entrepreneurship and cultural exchange. Global potential (gp) provides youth and communities the leadership and entrepreneurial skills to create renewed life perspectives to affect positive change locally and globally. Gp employs an holistic year and a half methodology that trains youth to become leaders through: media advocacy, social entrepreneurship, global awareness, community development, and service-learning. Gp empowers hundreds of passionate and dedicated volunteers to impact the gp programs. Each year, gp trains 500 youth aged between 15 to 23. These youth have high potential and self-vision to become leaders, changemakers and social entrepreneurs in their urban and rural low-income communities around the world. Most gp participants are first generation immigrant youth and originate from dozens of countries. Gp operates out of 16 high schools and ged programs in the us, france, the dominican republic, haiti and nicaragua.
