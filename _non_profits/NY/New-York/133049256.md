## Long description

Nyc-parents in action, inc. , a non-profit volunteer organization, is committed to the belief that effective communication, parent to parent and parent to child, is vital to the healthy development of young adults capable of making sound choices. We provide education, information and a communication network to inform parents about social and developmental issues, including substance abuse prevention. With these tools we strive to help parents communicate openly, effectively and consistently with their children. 'be involved, be informed, be connected'
  
  teen scene is our signature annual teen panel serves to educate parents on the issues from the teen point of view. We present a panel of children from all four high school grades, speaking candidly on 'what's out there' for a teen growing up in the nyc independent schools.
