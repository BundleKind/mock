## Long description

See schedule oproviding manpower training and related assistance and supportive services to unemployed and underemployed persons, particularly those from economically disadvantaged areas of the city and state of new york, including residents of new york city housing authority projects, in order to increase their self-sufficiency, maximize job opportunities and reduce unemployment in the city and state of new york. In 2014, the organization trained 50 low income residents of the new york city housing authority and local communities, through a course at new york city technical college on introductory construction skills. 86% of these trainees were placed in employment in the industry, and 50% are currently employed in the industry. Building on the success of this initial effort, in 2015, the organization partnered with local workforce providers to source candidates throughout new york city who are interested and able to work in the demanding field of construction. (continued on schedule o)over the course of the year the organization worked with these organizations to develop a process for preparing and vetting graduates of their programs who had the capacity for, and interest in, working in the construction industry, and in 2015 the organization placed 74 individuals in jobs in the industry. In 2016, the organization will expand the program to provide more jobs to low income new yorkers, and training for qualified candidates in a construction trade, to enable them to embark upon a career in the industry. This program is primarily supported by contributions.
