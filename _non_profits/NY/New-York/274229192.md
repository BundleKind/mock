## Long description

Polaris productions produces musical theater for young people, ages 8 through 22, to help them develop their craft and give them performance experience. This experience helps our young performers obtain work in theater, and helps them win admission to performing arts high schools and colleges. Participation in theater also teaches kids and teens the life skills they need to be successful as they transition into adulthood. Produced the classic musical 'me and my girl', performed by young people ages 6 through 25 in new york, ny. Twenty-five young actors took part, supported by four theater professionals and eight adult and teenage volunteers. In april 2014, six public performances were held at the hudson guild theater in manhattan, with a total audience participation of about 500 people.
