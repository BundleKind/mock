## Long description

Children's rights is a national advocacy group working to reform failing child welfare systems on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of abused and neglected children who depend on them. The organization is a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1994 and is exempt from federal income taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the u. S. Internal revenue code and from state and local taxes under comparable laws. In 2015, children's rights (cr) was engaged in litigation that jumpstarted reform: in south carolina the state is undertaking preliminary measures to improve services for children in foster care; in texas, a u. S. District court judge handed down a watershed ruling in favor of cr's plaintiff children, noting that many children leave the system more damaged than when they enter. Meanwhile, one of cr's longstanding reform campaigns may soon come to a close: in tennessee, the state reached a number of its mandated benchmarks in 2015 and is poised to exit court oversight in approximately a year.
