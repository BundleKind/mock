## Long description

Multicultural exposure to dance and the arts. Promote the full spectrum of the pan-african experience through performance and educational programs. With a philosophy based on the belief that arts in education is valuable and must be maintained as an integral part of educational goals, we developed and implement general and multicultural visual and performing arts instructional curricular. In addition, the dance companys repertoire consisted of works that present visual and emotional images of human experiences deeply rooted in tradition. Conveyance of these traditions occured through artistic expression via the universal medium of dance and the universal language of music.
