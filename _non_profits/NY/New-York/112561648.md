## Long description

To provide quality, compassionate and innovative client-centered services to victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable populations so that they may lead the safest and fullest lives possible. The urban resource institute's (uri) five domestic violence (dv) shelters (4 emergency dv shelters and 1 dv tier ii transitional shelter) provided services to approximately 1,600 victims (adults and children) of domestic/intimate partner violence. Each of the facilities operated with one of the highest occupancy rates in new york state. All sites provided access to comprehensive case management including safety planning, individual and group counseling, mental health assessments and referrals, housing placement assistance, children's services, recreation, and referrals for ancillary services. Uri expanded its innovative, people and animals living safely (pals) program, the first and only program in new york city of its kind, to an additional residential site to increase access for survivors of domestic violence and their pets through a co-sheltering model developed by the organization. In addition to the provision of direct residential support, uri's economic empowerment programs, through its working internship network (win) program, delivered career readiness and financial literacy services to shelter residents in order to support their re-entry into the workforce. Furthermore, uri's legal education and advocacy program (leap) provided clients with legal advice, advocacy, and representation.
