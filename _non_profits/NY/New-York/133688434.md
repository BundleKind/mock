## Long description

To transform the lives of accomplished high school students from low-income families by broadening their drams and preparing them for college success. Minds matter has twelve separately incorporated chapters across the country through affiliation/licensing agreements. Together, the organization and its affiliated chapters are served by more than 1,700 volunteers and fewer than ten paid staff. The national organization provides a variety of services to support the chapters, with most program expenses held at the chapter level and most administrative and fundraising expenses held by the organization. The national organization provides tools and resources to support each chapter's programming marketing, fundraising, legal, information technology, metrics/data management and financial management needs. All chapters are represented on the national board and share best practices within the network at least twice per month during our national executive commitee meetings and through technical assistance.
