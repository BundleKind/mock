  primary health care episcopal relief & development and its partners promote health and fight disease by empowering people and communities to protect themselves from common illnesses and increase overall health and well-being. Working with local churches and other partners, the organization's integrated programs prevent disease by caring for vulnerable mothers and their children, promoting nutrition and immunizations and increasing access to health care, clean water and adequate sanitation and hygiene. In partnership with health workers and clinics, episcopal relief & development's programs target diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and hiv/aids. In 2014, partners in 24 countries implemented primary health care programs: - training health workers to educate communities about disease prevention and providing medication and immunizations through local and mobile clinics - offering maternal and child health programs and caring for children orphaned by hiv/aids - preventing diseases such as malaria through education and intervention in 14 countries through the netsforlife malaria prevention program partnership.
