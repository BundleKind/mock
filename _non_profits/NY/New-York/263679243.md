## Long description

Women one is a non-profit whose aim is to help women around the world who are marginalized and who suffer because of their circumstances. The organization partners with other ngos and grass roots programs who work tirelessly on the ground in developing nations for communities who suffer because of civil war or persecution. Womenone is committed to the elimination of hunger, the elimination of poverty and the end of persecution of women and children. In jordan we hosted a documentary film and photography workshop for 20 out of school syrian refugee girls in zaatari camp and irbid to promote skill building, non-formal education and psychosocial well-being. The workshop culminated in a exhibit showcasing their work in irbid and amman.
