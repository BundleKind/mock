## Long description

Theatrical production of new plays by women playwrights. New georges, founded in 1992, is a strategically small company with a national reputation as a vigorous home for theatrically adventurous women artists. Through productions of new plays, several varieties of play and artist development programs, and our indispensable workspace, the room, we support the largest ongoing working community of women theater artists in new york city. Fy14 programs included:producing season: new georges wrapped its entire 2013-14 season into a festival, the new georges jam on toast, that highlighted the jam, our early-career theater makers lab, in the lounge and theater at dixon place on the lower east side. Jam on toast included three world premiere productions performed in rotating repertory: the vaults by caroline v. Mcgraw, directed by portia krieger; primal play, by krista knight, directed by jess chayes; a beautiful day in november on the banks of the greatest of the great lakes by kate benson, directed by lee sunday evans. The festival also included three workshop presentations of plays in progress; two one-time presentation events; and three cabaret-style lounge shows for 45 performances in 2. 5 weeks. Play and artist development in the room: programs include the audreyresidencies, a new program which expands on prior play development by adding a year-long residency component to time spent working on a new-play project in the room; mini-workshops, 3 to 5 rehearsals and one public presentation; this is your week, which grants directors a full week in the room to work on developmental or experimental projects of their choosing; and deadline readings, which encourage playwrights to finish early drafts of new scripts by promising an initial hearing and dramaturgical support;the jam, a working lab for early-career theater makers (playwrights anddirectors) in the room;subsidized workspace for affiliated artists in the room;new georges supported productions, which supports the production and development of new collaboration-driven work;affiliated artist services, such as playwright/director matching; playlibrary and casting files; networking events; and frequent e-mail blasts regarding opportunities at new georges and theaters nationwide;artist-initiated readings or workshop presentations of new workscreated/developed in the room.
