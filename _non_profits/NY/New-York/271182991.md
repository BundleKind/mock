## Long description

Blue engine, inc. Works in partnership with public high schools serving low-income communites to increase academic rigor and prepare dramatically greater numbers of students for postsecondary success. Blue engine recruits, trains, and supports a corps of blue engine teaching assistants (betas), recent college graduates who work alongside teachers in district high schools serving low-income communities. This year, 68 betas served 1,600 students across six schools in new york city. Betas increase academic rigor and college readiness by: reducing student-to-teacher ratios in math and literacy classes; utilizing data to inform personalized instruction; expanding learning time during and after school; teaching social cognitive skills; supporting postsecondary awareness and access initiatives. At the same time, blue engine staff develop betas as educators, with 1/3rd of betas still teaching today.
