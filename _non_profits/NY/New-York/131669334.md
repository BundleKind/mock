## Long description

The american federation of arts initiates and organizes a national and international program of art exhibitions, publications, and educational activities to benefit the museum community and enrich the public's experience and understanding of art and culture. Since its founding in 1909, the american federation of arts (afa) has been initiating and organizing exhibitions of both critical and popular acclaim. Afa exhibitions have been presented throughout the united states, as well as in canada, latin america, europe, and asia. The afa's curators initiate concepts for exhibitions, select the leading scholars in the field to act as the guest curator for each project, and then, together with publications, education, and registrarial staff, organize all aspects of the exhibition and its tour, including the publication of the catalogue and the development of educational materials. At any given time, the afa has approximately thirty exhibitions in various stages of development. Since the organization's inception, approximately three thousand exhibitions have traveled throughout the world under its auspices. Today, afa exhibitions are shown at museums across the country and abroad, attracting audiences of more than 1. 5 million visitors annually-statistics that position the afa in line with the ten most visited art museums in the country.
