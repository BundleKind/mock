## Long description

To identify emerging issues and problems pertaining to academic geriatric programs and provide a forum to enhance communication among geriatric program leaders. Adgap serves as a resource for information and data about academic geriatric programs. Adgap promotes the development of academic geriatric programs by assisting established geriatric medical programs in medical schools in the united states with expertise of its members and grant programs. The geriatric education coordinating center, known as the reynolds project serves as a coordinating center for the work being done by the aging and quality of life grantees. The reynolds project builds on the collaborations built over 12 years with the sharing of curriculum materials, successes, and lessons learned while transitioning annual reynolds grantee meetings into alternate forums for diffusion of geriatrics innovations. The reynolds project also provides a centralized website (pogoe) for disseminating reynolds grantees curriculum materials, lessons learned, successes, and overall program impact to all faculty and organizations interested in enhancing physician training in the care of older adults.
