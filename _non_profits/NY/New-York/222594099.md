The mission of pardes north america is to support the pardes institute of jewish studies in the realization of its vision and mission. Pardes institute of jewish studies north america, provides financial and managerial support for the pardes institute of jewish studies in jerusalem. Through its efforts, thousands of pardes alumni have acquired extraordinary jewish education at pardes in israel, and returning to the united states, and elsewhere around the globe to become teachers and/or leaders of jewish institutions, schools, and community organizations. Pardes students are generally graduates of the top colleges and universities in the u.

Many graduates assume professional leadership positions within the jewish community.
