## Long description

The mission is to seek out older people in the community who need assistance in managing life's daily activities or accessing essential services, and to provide them with the support and companionship they need to live with security and dignity in the manner they choose. As part of a full spectrum of care management, search & care assists clients who apply for benefits and entitlements, arranges homecare & transportation, advocates in legal, health care and housing matters, provides bill paying & budgeting assistance, assesses mental health needs (referring to appropriate therapeutic providers), arranges for weekday & weekend meals, facilitates therapeutic group programs, offers surrogate family-like support for isolated elders who have few, if any, available family or friends, matches clients with volunteers who assist with shopping and escort clients to medical and other appointments, and augments agency services with graduate occupational therapy and nursing interns who assist with nutritional assessments, blood pressure checks, home safety, emergency preparedness and socialization.
