## Long description

University plaza nursery school is a parent run cooperative nursery school that seeks to provide a high quality preschool experience for children in the surrounding community. University plaza nursery school (upns) is a parent cooperative in lower manhattan serving the neighborhoods of greenwich village, nolita, soho, noho, chelsea, tribeca and the east village. The cooperative model requires parents to perform a variety of jobs from classroom volunteers and creating newsletters, to fund raising and admissions. During the 2014-2015 school year, 39 pre-schoolers attended upns. Most of the families making up the cooperative were affiliated with new york university. Upns has served downtown families for almost 50 years and is highly regarded amongst educators and community members for providing excellent, age-appropriate early childhood education.
