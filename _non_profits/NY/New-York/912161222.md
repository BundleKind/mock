## Long description

The east african center for the empowerment of women and children is a community-based organization that provides education and health programs to several villages on kenyas coast. The eacs mission is to help communities achieve empowerment by increasing literacy for women and children, improving health status, and eradicating poverty. East african center provides adult and child education, health education and information, and poverty eradication programs in kenya. It has a school for grades kindergarten through 8th grade and a school farm that supplies food for the students everyday. The organization supports a team of 50 community health workers to inform the community about health, provide monitoring for post and pre-natal care, and economically empower families who support individuals with hiv/aids. Eacs primary approaches are to meet the stated needs of the community, partner with and build the capacity of local government rather than create parallel services, facilitate access to resources for true empowerment, and create sustainable programs.
