## Long description

America scores new york inspires urban youth to lead healthy lives, be engaged students, and have the confidence and character to make a difference in the world. We partnered with five public elementary and middle schools in west harlem and washington heights to provide our year-round literacy in action program, a nationally standardized curriculum of soccer, poetry and service learning for approximately 170 students and over 230 students when including outreach programming. Public school teacher-coaches lead teams of 3rd-5th or 6th-8th grade boys or girls in soccer and writing workshops 5 days per week. Students, coaches and families celebrated youth achievements at our regular community events throughout the year. Literacy in action is a holistic youth development program that encourages children to utilize their creativity to assist them to improve their literacy and athletic skills, seeking to increase self- esteem, build leadership skills and foster personal and academic success.
