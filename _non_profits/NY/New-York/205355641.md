## Long description

To alleviate poverty and promote social justice by strengthening women-led development initiatives and creating access to the us market for marginalized communities across the world. To alleviate poverty and promote social justice by strengthening women-led development initiatives and creating access to the u. S. Market for marginalized communities across the world. Ggp continued to develop its e-commerce site reaching a record number of retail customers. We expanded our custom market by offering products developed with the help of our in-house designer, and supplied exclusive merchandise for a boutique line as well as for large retailers. A strong focus on custom clients allowed us to minimize ggps inventory risk while employing a much larger number of artisans around the world. Ggp has continued to partner with an organization in guatemala by retailing a special charity bracelet collection. This program enables indigenous women in guatemala to improve their living circumstances with smokeless stoves and water filters. Further, we assisted several groups with capacity-building and enhancing safety measures.
