## Long description

Fedcap is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a mission to create opportunities for people with barriers to move toward economic independence as valued and contributing members of society. Founded in 1935 by three veterans with physical disabilities who struggled to find employment, fedcap serves thousands of people annually including veterans, people with physical and developmental disabilities, individuals with mental health issues, adults who've been in prison, and disconnected youth aging out of foster care and juvenile justice systems. Each year, fedcap offers an array of services through its four practice areas education, workforce development, occupational health, and economic development-helping more than 80,000 individuals graduate from high school, obtain vocational certification or a college degree, become work ready, obtain meaningful employment and achieve economic well-being. Economic development: fedcap has five operations designed to provide employment to people with disabilities and other barriers to employment which help improve the economic status of citizens in impoverished communities. These operations employ 1700 individuals the vast majority of whom were helped to overcome barriers to employment by fedcap. The operations span the northeast and mid-atlantic and include total facilities management, digital imaging and document maintenance, manufacturing, home health care and security. Our clients include the u. S. Department of defense, general services administration and environmental protection agency, the new york state department of labor, the council on the arts, the city university of new york, geico, kmart, restaurant associates, and many others.
