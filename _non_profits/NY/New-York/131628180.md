## Long description

Lenox hill neighborhood house is dedicated to helping those in need who live, work, or go to school on manhattan's east side, primarily the upper east side, and to improving the quality of life for all individuals and families in its community. The neighborhood house defines need broadly to include economic, social, emotional, and physical need, but gives priority to those in economic need. The house's objective is to help people gain the skills to strengthen themselves and their community. Homeless and housing services: the neighborhood house provides programs and services to homeless and formerly homeless men and women each year to help them gain independence and stability. Our homeless and housing services department provides support to hundreds of men and women each year who are homeless, formerly homeless, or threatened with eviction and life on the streets.
