## Long description

Based on chabad chassidic philosophical teachings incuding to love ones fellow as one loves oneself, chabad runs a recource center for students, faculty, staff, and alumni. We create programming and provide a space where community can gather and explore spirituality and values. Through the student center, programs are offered including social, educational, and cultural. The center also hosts a lending library.
