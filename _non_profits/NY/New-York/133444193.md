## Long description

New york cares meets pressing community needs by mobilizing caring new yorkers in volunteer service. 'each year, new york cares brings vital volunteer support to more than 1,300 nonprofit agencies, public schools and other deserving organizations throughout the five boroughs. Together, we are able to help more than 400,000 disadvantaged new yorkers, by: reading with children at some of our city's lowest performing schools; brightening the days of homebound seniors and those living with hiv/aids; helping adults entering the workforce with resume preparation; providing sat exam preparations to underserved high school students; providing warm winter coats and holiday gifts to men, women and children who would otherwise go without; and so much more.
