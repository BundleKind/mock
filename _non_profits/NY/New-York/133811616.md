## Long description

To facilitate the disposition and rehabilitation of certain city-owned parcels of real property. The organization took title to parcels (project sites) previously owned by the city of new york and selected for rehabilitation in neighborhood entrepreneurs program(nep), an affordable housing redevelopment program administered by the city of new york. Project sites are located in the neighborhoods where housing stock is generally old and badly deteriorated and where the median income level is significantly lower than other sections of the city. Through nep, the parcels are redeveloped and existing tenants are preserved with subsidized rents.
