## Long description

To diversify participation in opera through the mentorship of emerging operatic writers and the development of new works. Composer librettist development program - mentorship: alt continued to offer its acclaimed composer librettist development program in 2015. This program is the most extensive of its kind in the united states: a full-time resident artist program for emerging writers for the opera stage. The cldp includes a core curriculum of classroom training and hands-on workshops with some of the country's leading working artists, including composer/librettist mark adamo; dramaturg cori ellison; stage director lawrence edelson; and librettist mark campbell. In addition to ongoing classes and workshops, composers and librettists in the program take part in residency observerships at the metropolitan opera, during which time they have the opportunity to explore the rehearsal process of fully staged operatic productions. This combination of opportunities provides comprehensive and unique mentorship to those writing for the opera stage. (a total of 12 artists were served through the cldp)
