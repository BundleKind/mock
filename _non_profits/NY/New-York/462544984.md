## Long description

We believe that the best way to build a stronger africa is to foster future african leaders from diverse backgrounds. We provide our talented and motivated students with the skills, education and resources they need to become leaders in their own communities, creating a cycle of success. Children were provided with tuition, room and board, medical care, school supplies and leadership training.
