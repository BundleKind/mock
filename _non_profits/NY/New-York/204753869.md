## Long description

Develop vacant land into a supportive housing residence for housing works' overall client population: very low-income residents with histories of homelessness, mental illness, and/or chemical dependence. On the 6,000 square foot lot at 220 hull st. In brooklyn, housing works developed a four-story, 26-unit permanent supportive housing facility for homeless single adults with aids. In addition to safe, stable housing, residents have access to empowerment activities. Supportive services available to all residents on or off site through housing works includes case management, independent living skills training, health care, mental health care, harm reduction services, and eligibility to enroll in the housing works job training program.
